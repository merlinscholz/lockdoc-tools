How to call bb2lines for example:
./bb2lines -p /opt/kernel/linux-32-vanilla-kcov-gcov-4-10/ -b /opt/kernel/linux-32-vanilla-kcov-gcov-4-10/vmlinux -v 3 /opt/kernel/linux-32-vanilla-kcov-gcov-4-10/fs/ < pcs.txt > result.csv
or more general:
./bb2lines -p $FILE_PREFIX -b $BINARY $GCNO_DIR -v 3 < pcs.txt > result.csv


With the argument -p the prefix of the source files must be set. This prefix has to be determined by an experiment.
That means it must be read manually from the output "bb_read:" by calling
'./bb2lines -p . -b $BINARY_DIR/test $GCNO_DIR/ -v 3 < pcs.txt' first.

With the argument -b the binary on which the code coverage should be determined is given.

Finally the directory where the .gcno files are located must be specified. The program will recursively find all .gcno files inside.


Then the standard input is used to read in the pcs, which must be in hex form and line by line.

The result is then printed as csv on the standard output.

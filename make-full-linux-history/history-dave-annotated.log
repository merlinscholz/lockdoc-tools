commit 379a6be1eedb84ae0d476afbc4b4070383681178 (Dec 31 2000)

    Ok. I didn't make 2.4.0 in 2000. Tough. I tried, but we had some
    last-minute stuff that needed fixing (ie the dirty page lists etc), and the
    best I can do is make a prerelease.
    
    There's a 2.4.0-prerelease out there, and this is basically it. I want
    people to test it for a while, and I want to give other architectures the
    chance to catch up with some of the changes, but read my lips: no more
    recounts. There is no "prerelease1", to become "prerelease2" and so on.
    
    One thing other architectures will want to catch up with is the changes to
    handle 2GHz+ machines, which due to overflow issues caused "loops_per_sec"
    to become "loops_per_jiffy". And some architectures have not had much
    chance to synchronize with me due to other fires to put out.
    
    Give it your worst. After you recover from being hung-over, of course.

    The LDT fixes in particular fix some potentially random strange behaviour.
    And the alpha memmove() thing was a showstopper bug on alphas.
    
    		Linus
    
    - x86 LDT handling fixes: revert some cleanups (the LDT really
      doesn't act like a TLB context)
    - Richard Henderson: alpha update (working memmove() from Ivan
      Kokshaysky etc)
    - Manfred: winbond-840.c net driver update (fix oops on module unload etc)
    - Alan Cox: more synchronizations (with some fixes from Andrew Morton)

    Ok, there's a test13-pre6 out there now, which does a partial sync with
    Alan, in addition to hopefully fixing the innd shared mapping writeback
    problem for good.  Thanks to Marcelo Tosatti and others..
    
    I've pounded on the shared dirty page writeback logic quite a bit, and
    verified (by doing timings with "strace -ttT") that it should do the right
    thing with sync/fsync/fdatasync/msync(MS_ASYNC)/msync(MS_SYNC).
    
    The reason I'm fairly confident that the problem is gone for good is that
    the dirty page handling is now quite integral to the whole address space
    code, and it fell out rather nicely from some mapping host cleanups.
    
    Al: this changes "mapping->host" to be truly defined as a pointer to the
    inode that owns the mapping. That's how every user actually _used_ the
    host pointer, so this cleans those up to not need any casts. The main
    reason, however, is that we needed to have some FS-level anchor for dirty
    pages in order to get the correct sync() semantics. If you think it's
    worth it to have a notion of an anonymous host we need to add something
    else.
    
    Stephen: mind trying your fsync/etc tests on this one, to verify that the
    inode dirty stuff is all done right?
    
    Marco d'Itri and everybody else who has seen innd problems (or other
    shared map problems): can you verify that test13-pre6 works for you?

      unchanged by the BIOS. Fixes at least some IBM ThinkPads.

    - Andreas Dilger: proper ext2 compat flag checking

Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 23 15:41:02 2007 -0500

    The main notables are the network fixes (uninitialized skb->dev could and
    did cause oopses in ip_defrag) and the mm fixes (dirty pages without
    mappings etc, causing problems in page_launder).
    
    The mm cleanups also include removing "swapout()" as a VM operation, as
    nobody can sanely do anything more than just marking the page dirty anyway
    (the real work is done by writepage() these days), and doing that
    explicitly simplifies VM scanning considerably.
    
    This still doesn't tell "sync()" about dirty pages (ie the "innd loses the
    active file after a reboot" bug), but now the places that mark pages dirty
    are under control. Next step..

    - Geert Uytterhoeven: m68k update
    - David Miller: TCP RTO calc fix, UDP multicast fix etc
    - Duncan Laurie: ServerWorks PIRQ routing definition.
    - mm PageDirty cleanups, added sanity checks, and don't lose the bit.

    The most noticeable part of this is that the run_task_queue fix should
    cure the lockup that some people have seen.
    
    The shmfs cleanup should be unnoticeable except to users who use SAP with
    huge shared memory segments, where Christoph Rohlands work not only
    makes the code much more readable, it should also make it dependable..

    Ok, test10-final is out there now. This has no _known_ bugs that I
    consider show-stoppers, for what it's worth.
    
    And when I don't know of a bug, it doesn't exist. Let us rejoice. In
    traditional kernel naming tradition, this kernel hereby gets anointed as
    one of the "greased weasel" kernel series, one of the final steps in a
    stable release.
    
    We're still waiting for the Vatican to officially canonize this kernel,
    but trust me, that's only a matter of time. It's a little known fact, but
    the Pope likes penguins too.

    2.4.0-test10-pre7
    
    Ok, this one contains at least a preliminary fix for the problem with
    truncate together with a concurrent page access - the bug that causes
    oopses in block_read_full_page() and filemap_nopage().
    
    This is a fairly minimal fix, and I'll still have to verify that I caught
    all the relevant places, but I wanted people who have seen this problem to
    please test this out asap - I'll make a real test10 later once I've
    integrated some further patches from Alan and Jeff, but this should fix
    the major show-stopper bug.
    
            Thanks,

commit 91cd679a976fdc0ba33a7917911d182f8828d50d
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 23 15:39:38 2007 -0500

    Linux 2.4.0-test10-pre6
    
    pre6 has tons of small fixes, the most noticeable of which are
    
     (a) the new compiler requirements (sorry, but it turned out that 2.7.2.3
         really is too subtly broken with named structure initializers that
         are very heavily used these days inside the kernel)
    
         Suggested stable compiler: gcc-2.91.66, aka egcs-1.1.2, which is the
         one most vendors have been shipping for a long time, and while sure
         to be buggy too has not been found to be seriously so at least yet.
    
         Other modern gcc versions may well work too.
    
     (b) various PCI fixes that used to make 2.4.0 completely unboot/usable on
         certain machines (ALI chipsets with certain PIRQ routing tables and
         laptops with some docking bridges. Oh, and PIIX4 chipsets with USB
         enabled and certain other magic things going on).
    
         Let's hope that there aren't too many more of these. The ALI one in
         particular was "interesting" to chase down. More interesting than I
         personally need in my old age.
    
    The rest of the changes should be mostly unnoticeable.
    
    Still known: the same old "page->mapping = NULL" thing that has not seen
    an acceptable fix yet. If it wasn't for that, I'd have called this test10
    already and be done with it. Super-Al to the rescue (and no, that was not
    a reference to the current sad state of US politics).

    Linux 2.4.0-test8
    
    Ok, as the truncate problems really seem to be fixed, it's time to do an
    official test8, the first development kernel in about a year and a half
    that should have a working truncate() again. Thanks to everybody who
    tested, and especially to Al Viro who did a lot of the heavy lifting.
    
    There are a number of other various changes there too - the truncate fix
    itself was fairly small, it was just more complex than most problems that
    can be solved in 50 lines of code.
    
    The only one of any note that I'd like to point out directly is the
    clarification in the COPYING file, making it clear that it's only _that_
    particular version of the GPL that is valid for the kernel. This should
    not come as any surprise, as that's the same license that has been there
    since 0.12 or so, but I thought I'd make that explicit.
    
    Why? There's been some discussions of a GPL v3 which would limit licensing
    to certain "well-behaved" parties, and I'm not sure I'd agree with such
    restrictions - and the GPL itself allows for "any version" so I wanted to
    make this part unambigious as far as my personal code is concerned.
    
    The reason I wanted to mention that particular issue here explicitly
    (rather than as just a one-liner in the changelog) is that code written by
    others is obviously under _their_ discretion, and not limited by my
    personal foibles, fears and misgivings.
    
    If anybody wants to explicitly state that their code will be valid under
    any version of the GPL (current or future - whatever they may look like),
    please send patches to say so for the code in question. If you've used the
    FSF boiler-place copyright notice, you already have this in place (it says
    "v2 or later" - the FSF itself doesn't recommend v1 any more).
    
    (Me, I'm taking the careful "wait and see" approach. I don't know if a GPL
    v3 is imminent, and I don't know if the issues discussed will even
    _become_ real issues, so you might as well consider me a paranoid, if
    careful, bastard).

        - floppy driver capability cleanups. Use "request_region()".
        - handle dcache flushing when there are shared user mappings that
          may be dirty.
        - get rid of the "xxxx_ret()" user access macros. They are more complex than
          just doing the return directly and they hide what's going on.
        - fix up broken BIOSes that don't give unique ID's to different APICs
        - make more of the drm drivers compile on other platforms and know
          about the signal blocking issues.

        - re-enable asynchronous read-ahead code.

        - don't self-deadlock on the kbd_controller_lock when probing for the mouse

            different places. Better places.
     - per-CPU irq count area. Better for caches, simpler code.
     - "mem_map + MAP_NR(x)" => virt_to_page(x)
            (*) Purely syntactic change at this point. NUMA memory handling
            will take advantage of this during 2.5.x
     - page_address() returns (void *) to make it clearer that it is a
       virtual address (it's the reverse of "virt_to_page()", see above).
     - zimage builds should work again.
     - Make current gcc's able to compile the kernel.
     - fix irq probing in IDE driver: this caused strange irq problems for
       other drivers later on (notably PCMCIA, which is one of the few
       drivers to still probe for ISA interrupts on modern machines).
     - Intel microcode update update.

     - console driver does correct palette setting.  No more black screens

    Linux 2.4.0-test5
    
    The diff is pretty huge, to a
    large degree due to a bttv driver syntactic split-up and due to the NLS
    forward-port from 2.2.x.
    
    Other notable bugfixes:
     - the buggy Toshiba (and possibly others) BIOS memory reporting thing
       is fixed. Just ignore RAM that the BIOS reports in the 640k-1M range.
       The BIOS is confused.
     - Manfred Spraul found and fixed a SMP TLB invalidation problem with threads.
     - various architecture updates (arm, ia64, sparc, sh..)
     - MD driver cleanups
     - Toshiba floppy controller problem workaround
     - updated DRI code (works with XF86-4.0.1)
     - various driver updates (ToPIC CardBus should work, ide updates, etc)
     - "kfree_s()" is gone. It hasn't existed for several years, but people
       still used it. No more.
     - USB driver updates and fbcon cleanups
     - various othe rupdates I've repressed.

    Linux-2.4.0-test2
    
    There's a "test2" kernel out there now, integrating most of the -ac
    patches, and some code that wasn't in -ac.
    
    Normally, when you integrate almost 5MB of patches, bad things happen.
    This time, a miracle occurred. As I uploaded the resultant kernel, a
    specter of the holy penguin appeared before me, and said "It is Good. It
    is Bugfree".
    
    As if wanting to re-assure me that yes, it really =was= the holy penguin,
    it finally added "Do you have any Herring?" before fading out in a puff of
    holy penguin-smoke. Only a faint whiff of rancid fish remains as I type in
    these words..
    
    In short, not only are most of Alan's patches integrated, I have it on
    higher authority that the result is perfect.
    
    So if it doesn't compile for you, you must be doing something wrong.

    After doing too many last-minute updates of critical code that we really
    shouldn't have left this late (*), I'm going to calm things down. I've
    released 2.3.33 which fixes a few smaller problems with 2.3.32, and I'll
    let it quiet down a bit for a while.
    
    We're obviously not going to have a 2.4 this millenium, but let's get the
    pre-2.4 series going this year, with the real release Q1 of 2000.
    
    		Linus
    
    (*) Both the mm layer and the SCSI layer was changed quite a lot: we'll be
    better for it, but I'd have been happier if we hadn't needed to.

    Linux 2.3.15
    
    There's a rather huge patch-set out there now, taking the 2.3.x series to
    2.3.15.
    This has a lot of the merge code I've been sent over the last two weeks,
    but I will invariably have missed some, if for no other reason than simply
    that I got absolutely _flooded_ by people sending me patches.
    
    One of the more interesting things was the SMP pipe cleanup sent by
    Richard, but try as I might it was never really stable under load on x86 -
    not with the plain semaphores in 2.3.14, and not with the patches Andrea
    had either. I assume Richard tested it on an alpha with the much more
    well-thought-out atomic operation that the alpha provides.
    
    I ended up rewriting the x86 semaphore code (and some of Richards pipe
    code too, for that matter, to get rid of some races in waking things up),
    and it doesn't show the problems I saw before, but hey, maybe I just
    exchanged one set of problems for another set that I can't trigger any
    more. Give me feedback, please.
    
    Other features that don't impact everybody, but are rather major:
     - ATM support merged in
     - firewalling is gone (again), replaced by an even more generic netfilter
       facility.
     - general networking merges and updates
     - Various driver updates (ISDN, ISA PnP, sound, fbcon, usb, intelliport,
       you name it)
     - make system call return type "long" even if the system call only
       returns valid data in the lower order bits - we use the high bits for
       error handling, and some 64-bit architectures care (read: the Merced
       calling conventions want this because they don't automatically extend
       the return type - I bet it will be a new portability issue for other
       programs than just the kernel)
    
    Have fun,
                    Linus

    The new and much improved fully page-cache based filesystem code is now
    apparently stable, and works wonderfully well performancewise. We fixed
    all known issues with the IO subsystem: it scales well in SMP, and it
    avoids unnecessary copies and unnecessary temporary buffers for write-out.
    
    The shared mapping code in particular is much cleaner and also a _lot_
    faster.
    
    In short, it's perfect. And we want as many people as possible out there
    testing out the new cool code, and bask in the success stories..
    HOWEVER. _Just_ in case something goes wrong [ extremely unlikely of
    course. Sure. Sue me ], we want to indeminfy ourselves. There just might
    be a bug hiding there somewhere, and it might eat your filesystem while
    laughing in glee over you being naive and testing new code. So you have
    been warned.
    
    In particular, there's some indication that it might have problems on
    sparc still (and/or other architectures), possibly due to the ext2fs byte
    order cleanups that have also been done in order to reach the
    afore-mentioned state of perfection.
    I'd be especially interested in people running databases on top of Linux:
    Solid server in particular is very fsync-happy, and that's one of the
    operations that have been speeded up by orders of magnitude.

    Linux 2.3.7pre6
    
    Anybody who is interested in FS performance should take a look at the
    latest pre-patch of 2.3.7 (only pre-6 and possibly later: do NOT get any
    earlier versions. pre-5 still causes file corruption, pre-6 looks good so
    far).
    
    Careful, though: I fixed the problem that caused some corruption less than
    an hour ago, and while my tests indicate it all works fine, this is a very
    fundamental change. The difference to earlier kernels is:
    
     - ext2 (and some other block device filesystems that have been taught
       about it) uses write-through from the page cache instead of having a
       separate buffer cache and the page cache to maintain dirty state. This
       means much less memory pressure in certain situations, and it also
       means that we can avoid unnecessary copies.
     - the page cache has been threaded, so on SMP you can actually get
       noticeable speedups from processes that do concurrent file accesses.
     - lower-latency read paths, especially the cached case.
    
    Both of these are big, and fundamental changes. So don't mistake me when I
    say it is experimental: Ingo, David and I have been spending the last
    weeks (especialy Ingo, who deserves a _lot_ of credit for this all: I
    designed much of it, but Ingo made it a reality. Thanks Ingo) on making it
    do the right thing and be stable, but if you worry about not having
    backups you might not want to play with it even so. It took us this long
    just to make it work reliably enough that we can't find any obvious
    problems..
    
    The interesting areas are things like
     - writes to shared mappings now go blindingly fast. We're talking mondo
       cleanups here. We used to do really badly on this, now we do really
       well.
     - does bdflush still do the right thing? There may be a _lot_ of tweaking
       to do to get everything working at full capacity.
     - can people confirm that it is stable for everybody?
     - if anybody has 8-way machines etc, scalability is interesting. It
       should scale to 8-way no problem. We used to scale to 1-way, barely.
       Numbers?
     - fsync(). It doesn't work right now, but it should be easy to make it
       work well on big files etc - something we've never been able to do
       before (we used to lack the indexing from file to dirty blocks: now we
       have access to that quite automatically thanks to having the
       inode->page index in place, and the dirty blocks are right there)
    
    and I'd really appreciate comments from people, as long as people are
    aware that it _looks_ stable but we don't guarantee anything at this
    point.

    Linux 2.3.7pre1
    
    I'd like to point out that the current pre-2.3.7 series is fairly
    experimental. As amply demonstrated by the filename (the "dangerous" part
    in the filename hopefully made some people go "Hmm..").
    
    We're working on re-architecting (or rather, cleaning up so that it works
    like it really was supposed to) the page cache writing, and as a result a
    number of filesystems are probably going to be broken for a while unless
    we get people jumping in to help.
    
    Right now 2.3.7-1 (aka "dangerous") is not stable even with ext2, in that
    swapping doesn't work. Ingo just sent me patches to fix that, and I'm
    hoping to remove the "dangerous" part from 2.3.7-2, but even then a number
    of filesystems will be broken.
    
    We _may_ end up just re-introducing the "update_vm_cache()" code for
    filesystems that really don't need the added performance, but it would
    actually be preferable if people really wanted to make them perform well
    with the new direct write-through cache code.

    Linux-2.3.3 and a short hiatus..
    
    There's a Linux-2.3.3 out there on ftp.kernel.org, this one hopefully
    fixes pretty much all the waitqueue changes (and I'll disable waitqueue
    debugging in 2.3.4 unless something comes up).
    
    And yes, before anybody tells me, I know I forgot to increment the version
    number. So "uname" is goign to report 2.3.2 unless you fix that by hand.
    I'm also leaving for a very quick trip to Finland in another two hours, so
    don't bother emailing me - please discuss isues on the kernel list, and
    
    I'll catch up when I get back on Friday (yes, I'll spen as much time in

    As to 2.3.x, we're beginning with a long overdue waitqueue cleanup, which
    means that a lot of small details need to get fixed in a variety of files.
    A working pre-patch of this is to be found as pre-patch-2.3.1-3, but not
    all drivers have been fixed - and help is appreciated (even drivers that
    _have_ been fixed have not necessarily actually been tested due to lack of

    Linux 2.2.8
    
    Most of 2.2.8 by far is just architecture updates: arm, ppc and m68k stand
    out as having been pretty much synchronized to their respective devel
    trees, but there are some fixes to alpha and x86 too.
    
    The one major fix in 2.2.8 is the SMP fix for disable_irq(), courtesy of
    Andrea Arcangeli (I disagreed in details and did it differently in the
    end, but all the heavy lifting was done by Andrea). This is the thing that
    caused silenth deaths for some people with certain network adapters (3c509
    and 8390-based cards in particular: the latter covers ne2000 clones which
    are fairly common).
    
    There are lots of smaller things (driver updates, filesystem cleanups and
    some networking fixes), but the SMP irq thing is the one to kill for if
    you happened to have any of the affected cards.

    There's a pre-3 patch on ftp.kernel.org in the kernel/testing directory,
    and I'd really like people to give it a good testing: especially if you've
    seen slow network connections to some clients (ie Windows). David worked
    in the compatibility patches to work around some of the Windows TCP stack
    "features" (and Apple too, for that matter), and we want to get this well
    tested. It's all fairly straightforward, but let's be careful out there..

    Linux 2.2.5 - and a vacation
    
    I made Linux-2.2.5 yesterday (as some people already have noticed: due to
    popular demand I try to delay the announcement for some time in order to
    let the thing percolate to mirror sites, in case anybody wondered).
    The 2.2.5 release is meant to be a final cleanup release before I leave
    for a two-week vacation. So please take these release notes to also mean
    that it is probably a good idea to hold off emailing me stuff directly,
    unless it is a major bug that you really think I should look at
    immediately. I would suggest people discuss problems on the mailing list
    and on the newsgroups, where other competent people are, rather than
    expecting me to do much about it.
    
    Also, note that there have been various indications that egcs potentially
    miscompiles the kernel, or at least makes some problems worse. We don't
    know whether that is due to one or more kernel bugs, compiler problems, or
    just combinations of "features" in both. I would suggest that if you have
    problems you at least verify whether the problems still exist with
    gcc-2.7.2.
    
    That said, I bet that both the kernel people and the egcs people would be
    really happy the more people look into this - if somebody feels motivated
    enough and sees problems with egcs, it would be extremely powerful to try
    to pinpoint the particular file that seems to bring on the problems. I'm
    afraid it needs a known failure mode and lots of legwork to find out what
    triggers it, though.
    
     - compiles with accounting.
     - add support for Microgate SyncLink and Synchronous HDLC
     - stallion driver update
     - alpha EV6 and SMP fix for bootup with newer compilers
     - ptrace fix for sparc/i386
     - small sparc updates
     - floppy driver could oops at bootup under certain setups
     - random driver updates (bw-qcam, sound driver error codes, etc oneliners)
     - FIOASYNC ioctl fix
     - network locking fixes
     - SMP "struct user" and signal sending fixes
    
    Have fun, because I will,

    Linux 2.2.4
    
    As of 2.2.4, I should be synchronized with the Sparc[64] and PPC ports,
    which is the major reason why the patch is pretty huge. Apart from the
    architecture synchronizations, 2.2.4 does:
    
     - dumping core over NFS could do bad things. Core-dumping cleaned up and
       fixed.
    
     - various small TCP/IP buglets fixed. Linux got confused by hosts that
       didn't report any mss, and had problems with zero-sized fragments, etc.
    
     - various small, often silly bugs fixed (PC BIOS PCI buglet, alpha
       semaphores, bottom half interrupts, fork() returns wrong error code).
    
     - tons of driver updates
    
     - updated net scheduling code (CONFIG_NET_SCHED)
    
    Most of the fixes aren't all that noticeable, but some of them can be
    showstoppers depending on whether you've ever seen them.

    Linux 2.2.3pre3
    
    There's a new pre-patch for 2.2.3, one that I was already going to make
    the final 2.2.3, but I decided that I'm chicken after all, and that I
    might as well let some people check that it's sane.
    This pre-2.2.3 does:
    
     - Fix some silly NFS problems. Some of them can be quite bad: lost error
       notification of asynchronous writes, which can result in horrible
       problems (including lost email etc). Most people wouldn't ever notice,
       so don't panic, but forgetting about the error notification certainly
       counts as a brown paper bag.
     - Alpha should compile and work again
     - Various driver updates. This is actually the bulk of the patch, with
       IRDA updates, some scsi, video and sound driver updates etc.
     - The "mmap forgets about the file that was mapped" bug that has been
       discussed here. Only affected certain drivers.
     - shaper atomicity fixes
     - various minor TCP fixes
     - buffer growth fix and recursive IO memory reclaim fix from Andrea
     - network filter compiles ;)
     - unix gc fixes
    
    Tell me if you see problems, because I'm going to release it as 2.2.3
    unless people tell me otherwise..

    Linux 2.2.2pre4
    
    In a superhuman effort to not get killed by my wife, I delayed the latest
    release for a day. And in fact, it's still just a pre-release, because I
    wanted to check with Ingo that I have his latest IO-APIC code with the
    proper handling of ExtINT. Ingo?
    
    Anyway, the "not quite valentine days release" (also known as the "horny
    greased weasel", aka "presidents day" release ;), is right now a pre-patch
    on ftp.kernel.org: /pub/linux/kernel/testing/pre-patch-2.2.2-4.gz.
    
    Happily, I haven't heard of any new real show-stoppers, which is good
    (especially considering the fact that I gave it an extra week just to hear
    if somebody could come up with some new problems). The things fixed
    relative to 2.2.1 are:
    
     - the inode thing. If you don't know, don't worry.
     - config scripts updated
     - IO-APIC cleanups and fixes, so that people with strange motherboards
       should be able to reboot cleanly and not get unexpected interrupts.
     - 2kB sector media (ie mostly MO) fixes. See all the warnings on the
       lists about fdisk confusion etc if you have one of these things.
     - IDE disk cleanups/fixes (geometry and autodetection)
     - PS/2 mouse hides ACK's again
     - pty crash fix
     - some network driver fixes (out-of-memory and shared interrupts)
     - some sound and video updates.
     - lockd cookie fixes
     - nfsd readdir reply cache fix
     - filesystem/VM deadlock avoidance (new deamon: kpiod)
     - SMP scheduler race condition (which nobody has probably ever seen)
     - TCP socket locking fix
    
    Most of the above are really hard to see in the first place, and not
    something most people would ever hit (with the possible exception of the
    inode thang).  But it would be good to have a really rock solid 2.2.2, so
    if people could just bother to check that it works for them, and I'll make
    this official tomorrow.

    Linux 2.2.2-pre2
    
    this one contains various small documentation updates and updates to xconfig,
    but the important parts (and the smallest part of the actual patch) are:
    
     - shared file lockup fix by Stephen Tweedie
     - my fix for the TCP bug that Ingo found
     - Ingo's io-apic setup fixes, which should finally get rid of the
       spurious apic interrupts with some motherboards and the ExtINT setup.
     - inode leak thing
     - SMP scheduler potential race condition fix
     - sound driver updates
     - partition and disk fixes (2kB blocksize media and some IDE disk
       geometry and irq detection issues).
    
    None of the fixes are critical to most people, but all of them _can_ be
    critical to people who have seen vulnerabilities in the area. As such, if
    you're happy with 2.2.1 there is no pressing reason to test this patch
    out, but I hope to have the pre-patches so that the final 2.2.2 can be
    left around for a while (CD-ROM manufacturers etc would certainly prefer
    to not see lots of releases).

    Ok, this seems to be due to pre9 removing some rather bogus code that
    happened to hide another problem in open_namei().
    I haven't actually tested this, but it looks really obvious, so does this
    patch fix it for you? (This should also fix a potential performance
    bogosity - there's absolutely no reason why we should get the directory
    lock when we don't need to for a normal open of an existing file).

    2.2.0-final
    
    Hoya,
     there's now a 2.2.0-pre9 on ftp.kernel.org, and when you compile it it
    will call itself 2.2.0-final. The reason is fairly obvious: enough is
    enough, and I can't make pre-kernels forever, it just dilutes the whole
    idea. The only reason the tar-file is not called 2.2.0 is that I want to
    avoid having any embarrassing typos that cause it to not compile under
    reasonable configurations or something like that. Unreasonable
    configurations I no longer care about.
    
    Every program has bugs, and I'm sure there are still bugs in this. Get
    over it - we've done our best, and nobody ever believed that there
    wouldn't be 2.2.x kernels to fix problems as they come up, and delaying
    2.2.0 forever is not an option.
    
    I have a wedding anniversary and a company party coming up, so I'm taking
    a few days off - when I get back I expect to take this current 2.2.0-final
    and just remove the "-final" from the Makefile, and that will be it. I
    suspect somebody _will_ find something embarrassing enough that I would
    fix it too, but let's basically avoid planning on that.
    In short, before you post a bug-report about 2.2.0-final, I'd like you to
    have the following simple guidelines:
     "Is this something Linus would be embarrassed enough about that he would
      wear a brown paper bag over his head for a month?"
    and
     "Is this something that normal people would ever really care deeply
      about?"
    
    If the answer to either question is "probably not", then please consider
    just politely discussing it as a curiosity on the kernel mailing lists
    rather than even sending email about it to me: I've been too busy the last
    few weeks, and I'd really appreciate it if I could just forget the worries
    of a release for a few days..
    
    But if you find something hilariously stupid I did, feel free to share it
    with me, and we'll laugh about it together (and I'll avoid wearing the
    brown paper bag on my head during the month of February). Do we have a
    deal?
    
    I've seen people working on a 2.2.0 announcement, and I'm happy - I've
    been too busy to think straight, much less worry about details like that.
    If everything turns out ok, I'll have a few memorable bloopers in my
    mailbox but nothing worse than that, and I can sit down and actually read
    the announcement texts that people have been discussing.
    
    ObFeatures:
     - m68k sync
     - various minor driver fixes (irda, net drivers, scsi, video, isdn)
     - SGI Visual Workstation support
     - adjtimex update to the latest standards
     - vfat silly buglet fix
     - semaphores work on alpha again
     - drop the inline strstr() that gcc got wrong whatever we did
     - kswapd needed to be a bit more aggressive
     - minor TCP retransmission and delack fixes

    Linux 2.2.0pre7
    
    Ok, I think I now know why pre-6 looks so unbalanced. It's two issues.
    Basically, trying to swap out a large number of pages from one process
    context is just doomed. It bascially sucks, because
    
     - it has bad latency. This is further excerberated by the per-process
       "thrashing_memory" flag, which means that if we were unlucky enough to
       be selected to be the process that frees up memory, we'll probably be
       stuck with it for a long time. That can make it extremely unfair under
       some circumstances - other processes may allocate the pages we free'd
       up, so that we keep on being counted as a memory trasher even if we
       really aren't.
       Note that this shows most under "moderate" load - the problem doesn't
       tend to show itself if you have some process that is _really_
       allocating a lot of pages, because then that process will be correctly
       found by the trashing logic. But if you have lots of "normal load"
       processes, some of those can get really badly hurt by this.
       In particular, the worst case you have a number of processes that all
       allocate memory, but not very quickly - certainly not more quickly than
       we can page things out. What happens is that under these circumstances
       one of them gets marked as a "scapegoat", and once that happens all the
       others will just live off the pages that the scapegoat frees up, while
       the scapegoat itself doesn't make much progress at all because it is
       always just freeing memory for others.
       The really bad behaviour tends to go away reasonably quickly, but while
       it happens it's _really_ unfair.
     - try_to_free_pages() just goes overboard, and starts paging stuff out
       without getting back to the nice balanced behaviour. This is what
       Andrea noticed.
       Essentially, once it starts failing the shrink_mmap() tests, it will
       just page things out crazily. Normally this is avoided by just always
       starting from shrink_mmap(), but if you ask try_to_free_pages() to try
       to free up a ton of pages, the balancing that it does is basically
       bypassed.
    
    So basically pre-6 works _really_ well for the kind of stress-me stuff
    that it was designed for: a few processes that are extremely memory
    hungry. It gets close to perfect swap-out behaviour, simply because it is
    optimized for getting into a paging rut.
    
    That makes for nice benchmarks, but it also explains why (a) sometimes
    it's just not very nice for interactive behaviour and (b) why it under
    normal load can easily swap much too eagerly.
    
    Anyway, the first problem is fixed by making "trashing" be a global flag
    rather than a per-process flag. Being per-process is really nice when it
    finds the right process, but it's really unfair under a lot of other
    circumstances. I'd rather be fair than get the best possible page-out
    speed.
    
    Note that even a global flag helps: it still clusters the write-outs, and
    means that processes that allocate more pages tend to be more likely to be
    hit by it, so it still does a large part of what the per-process flag did
    - without the unfairness (but admittedly being unfair sometimes gets you
    better performance - you just have to be _very_ careful whom you target
    with the unfairness, and that's the hard part).
    
    The second problem actually goes away by simply just not asking
    try_to_free_pages() to free too many pages - and having the global
    trashing flag makes it unnecessary to do so anyway because the flag will
    essentially cluster the page-outs even without asking for them to be all
    done in one large chunk (and now it's not just one process that gets hit
    any more).
    
    There's a "pre-7.gz" on ftp.kernel.org in testing, anybody interested?
    It's not the real thing, as I haven't done the write semaphore deadlock
    thing yet, but that one will not affect normal users anyway so for
    performance testing this should be equivalent.

    Linux 2.2.0pre2 (December 31 1998)
    
    Well, some people obviously had problems with the first 2.2.0pre, so
    there's a second one there. Most of it is almost purely syntactic sugar:
    configuration issues and jiffies wraparound, but there were a few problems
    wrt some IDE disk geometry stuff in particular that made 2.2.0pre1 not
    boot for some people.
    
    Other real changes:
     - nfsd updated, and we have an official maintainer for knfsd (and I was
       happy by how many people were ready to stand up for it. Good show,
       guys!)
     - network driver updates (tulip/eepro)
     - some TCP fixes for occasional but nasty performance problems.
     - fix for an attack where you could cause a complete and utter lockup of
       the kernel as a normal user. Thanks to Michael Chastain for keeping the
       faith on this one and reminding me to fix it.
    
    If you haven't had problems with pre1, there should be no major cause to
    look at pre2. But if you haven't even looked at pre1 yet, please consider
    looking at the pre-2.2.0 kernels before it's too late. I'm going to be
    extremely rude to people who knew better but didn't test out the pre-
    kernels and then send me bug-reports on the released 2.2.0.

    pre-2.1.132-4..
    
    There's a new pre-patch on ftp.kernel.org. I've been waiting for a few
    other things, but the pre-patches are getting to be so big that it's
    getting unwieldly, so I'll probably make a real 2.1.132 real soon now. In
    the meantime, there's a pre-patch that people can verify for sanity (this
    one should have coda-fs back to working order, for example - patch
    craziness corrupted a simple update in pre-3).

    pre-2.1.132-2..
    
    ..is out there, and has everybodys favourite fix, ie the version number
    has been bumped this time. In addition, compared to pre-1, it has:
     - autofs fix (uninitialized inode number could lead to "interesting"
       problems)
     - some more NFS fixes (file truncation with pending write-backs this time)
     - disable_irq()/enable_irq() now nests properly, as Alan convinced me
       (quite rightly) that they have to nest in order to work sanely with
       shared interrupt and multiple CPU's and various other schenarios.
     - more merges from Alan, we're getting closer to being synched up.
    Most of the bulk of the thing is the irda stuff, that most people can

    Linux 2.1.132pre1
    
    There's a new pre-patch out there. I'm back from Finland, and have caught
    up with just about half the email that I got during the stay. However,
    even the part I caught up with I may have partly missed something in,
    because (for obvious reasons) I didn't read them as carefully (*) as I
    usually do.
    
    This should fix at least part of the NFS problems people have reported:
    there was code to completely incorrectly invalidate quite valid write
    requests under some circumstances. The pre-patch also contains the first
    batch of patches merged in from Alan, and the "rmdir" problems should be
    fixed (mostly thanks to Al Viro).
    
    This pre-patch also gets rid of some imho completely unnecessary
    complexity in some of the VM memory freeing routines. There have been
    patches floating around that added more heuristics on when to do
    something, and this tries to get the same result by just removing old
    heuristics that didn't make much sense.

    (*) Even my usual "careful" is not very careful by other peoples
    standards. So when _I_ say that I wasn't very careful, you should just
    assume that I was reading my email about as carefully as a hyper-active
    hedgehog on some serious uppers. Can you say "ignored email" three times
    quickly while chewing on an apple?

    2.1.131 is out there now - and will be the last kernel release for a
    while. I'm going to Finland for a week and a half, and will be back mid
    December. During that time I hope people will beat on this. I'll be able
    to read email when I'm gone, but as I haven't been back in over a year,
    I'm not very likely to.
    
    Alan, I have got any replies (positive or negative) about the VFS fixes in
    pre-2.1.131-3 (which are obviously in the real 131 too), so I hope that
    means that I successfully fixed all filesystems. The chance of that being
    true is remote, but hey, I can hope.  If not, I assume you'll be doing
    your ac patches anyway (any bugs wrt rmdir() should be fairly obvious once
    seen), and people might as well consider those official..

    pre-patch-2.1.131-3
    
    Ok,
     I've made a new pre-patch-2.1.131-3.
    
    The basic problem (that Alexander Viro correctly diagnosed) is that the
    inode locking was horribly and subtly wrong for the case of a "rmdir()"
    call. What rmdir() did was essentially something like
    
     - VFS: lock the directory that contains the directory to remove
       (this is normal and required to make sure that the name updates are
       completely atomic - so removing or adding anything requires you to hold
       the lock on the directory that contains the removee/addee)
     - low-level filesystem: lock the directory you're going to remove, in
       order to atomically check that it's empty.
    
    So far so good, the above makes tons of sense. HOWEVER, the problem is
    fairly obvious if anybody before Alexander had actually bothered to think
    about it: when we hold two locks, we had better make sure that we get the
    locks in the right order, or we may end up deadlocked with two (or more)
    processes getting the locks in the wrong order and waiting on each other.
    
    Now, if it was only rmdir(), things would be fine, because the directory
    hierarchy itself imposes a lock order for rmdir(). But we have another
    case that needs to lock two directories: "rename()". And that one doesn't
    have the same kind of obvious order, and uses a different way to order the
    two locks it gets. BOOM.
    
    As far as I can tell, this is a problem in 2.0.x too, but while it's a
    potential really nasty DoS-opening, it does have the saving grace that the
    window to trigger it is really really small. I don't know if you can
    actually make an exploit for it that has any real chance of hitting it,
    but it's at least conceptually possible.
    
    Now, the only sane fix was to actually make the VFS layer do all the
    locking for rmdir(), and thus let the VFS layer make sure the order is
    correct, so that low-level filesystems don't need to worry their pretty
    heads. I tried to do that in the previous pre-patch, and it worked well
    for ext2, but not all that much else. The problem was that too many
    filesystems "knew" what the rmdir() downcall used to do. Oh, well.
    
    Anyway, I've fixed the low-level filesystems as far as I can tell, and the
    end result is a much cleaner interface (and one less bug). But it's an
    interface change at a fairly late date, and while the fixes to smbfs etc
    looked for the most part obvious, I haven't been able to test them, so
    I've done most of them "blind".
    
    Sadly, this bug couldn't just be glossed over, because a normal user could
    (by knowing the exact right incantation) force tons of unkillable
    processes that held critical filesystem resources (any lookup on a
    directory that was locked would in turn also lock up). So I'd ask people
    who have done filesystems for Linux to look over my changes, and if the
    filesystems are not part of the standard distribution please look over
    your own locally maintained fs code. I think we can ignore 2.0.x by virtue
    of it probably being virtually impossible to trigger. I'll leave the
    decision up to Alan.
    
    Most specially, I'd like to have people who use/maintain vfat and umsdos
    filesystems to test out that I actually made those filesystems happy with
    my changes. The other filesystems were more straightforward.
    
    Oh, and thanks to Alexander. Not that I really needed another bug to fix,
    but it feels good to plug holes.
    
                            Linus
    
    The change is basically:
     - the VFS layer locks the directory to be removed for you (as opposed to
       just the directory that contains the directory to be removed as it used
       to). A lot of filesystems didn't actually do this, and it is required,
       because otherwise the test for an empty directory may be subverted by a
       clever hacker.
     - the VFS layer will have done a dcache "prune" operation on the
       directory, and if there were no other uses for that dcache entry, it
       will have done a "d_drop()" on it too.
     - the above essentially means that any filesystem can do a
            if (!list_empty(&dentry->d_hash))
                    return -EBUSY;
       to test whether there are other users of this directory. No need to do
       any extra pruning etc - if it's been dropped there won't be any new
       users of the dentry afterwards, so there are no races. So after doing
       the above test you know that you'll have exclusive access to the dentry
       forever.
       Most notably, the low-level filesystem should _not_ look at the
       dentry->d_count member to see how many users there are. The VFS layer
       currently artificially raises the dentry count to make sure
       "d_delete()" doesn't get rid of the inode early.
     - however: traditional local UNIX-type filesystems tend to want to allow
       removing of the directory even if it is in use by something else. This
       requires that the inode be accessible even after the rmdir() - even
       though it doesn't necessarily need to actually _do_ anything.
       For a normal UNIX-like filesystem this tends to be trivial and quite
       automatic behaviour, but you need to think about whether your
       filesystem is of the kind where the inode stays around even after the
       delete until we locally do the final "iput()". For example, on
       networked filesystems this is generally not true, simply because the
       server will have de-allocated the inode even if we still have a
       reference to it locally.

    The Basted Turkey Release (aka 2.1.130)
    
    Following hot on the heels of the greased weasel, the basted turkey rears
    its handsome head.
    
    The basted turkey release fixes some problems that our dear weasel had,
    namely:
     - NFS reference counting was wrong. It had been wrong for a long time,
       but apparently the more aggressively asynchronous code was more easily
       able to show the resultant random memory corruption. That should be
       gone.
     - The UP flu fixed officially (this has been in most of the 2.1.129
       patches)
     - kernel_thread() used to be able to cause bad things in init-routines at
       bootup. Fixed.
     - itimers could lead to bad things in SMP under heavy itimer load.
     - various mm tweaks to make it behave better under load. Things for dirty
       buffers still under consideration.
     - IP masqerading check fixes.
     - acenic gigabit ethernet driver
     - some drunken revelers fixed some MCA issues.
     - alpha PCI setup updates and video drivers
     - hfs and minix filesystem fixes.
    
    On the whole, an excellent thing to do this evening, and goes together
    remarkably well with some good red wine. Amaze your friends and relatives
    by completely ignoring them, sitting in a corner with your own basted
    turkey, and getting wasted on red wine. Much more fun than your average
    thanksgiving dinner,

    pre-2.1.130-3
    
    There's a new pre-patch for people who want to test these things out: I'll
    probably make a real 2.1.130 soon just to make sure all the silly problems
    in 2.1.129 are left behind (ie the UP flu in particular that people are
    still discussing even though there's a known cure).
    
    The pre-patch fixes a rather serious problem with wall-clock itimer
    functions, that admittedly was very very hard to trigger in real life (the
    only reason we found it was due to the diligent help from John Taves that
    saw sporadic problems under some very specific circumstances - thanks
    John).
    
    It also fixes a very silly NFS path revalidation issue: when we
    revalidated a cached NFS path component, we didn't update the revalidation
    time, so we ended up doing a lookup over the wire every time after the
    first time - essentially making the dcache useless for path component
    caching of NFS. If you use NFS heavily, you _will_ notice this change (it
    also fixes some rather ugly uses of dentries and inodes in the NFS code
    where we didn't update the counter so the inode wasn't guaranteed to even
    be there any more!).
    
    Also, thanks to Richard Gooch &co, who found the rather nasty race
    condition when a kernel thread was started from an init-region. The
    trivial fix was to not have the kernel thread function be inlined, but
    while fixing it was trivial, it wasn't trivial to notice in the first
    place. Good debugging.
    
    And the UP flu is obviously fixed here (as it was in earlier pre-patches
    and in various other patches floating around).

    To a large degree is more merges for PPC and Sparc (and
    somehow I must have missed ARM _again_, so I'll have to find that).
    
    But there's a few other things in there:
     - ncr53c8xx tag fix
     - more sound fixes.
     - NFS fixed
     - some subtle TCP issues fixed
     - and lots of mm smoothness tweaks (most of those have been floating
       around for some time - like getting rid of the last vestiges of page
       ages which just complicated and hurt the code)
    
    Have fun with it, and tell me if it breaks. But it won't. I'm finally
    getting the old "greased weasel" feeling back. In short, this is the much
    awaited perfect and bug-free release, and the only reason I don't call it
    2.2 is that I'm chicken.

    Linux 2.1.127
    
    Ok,
     after two fairly hectic weeks for me, 2.1.127 is finally out there.
    
    This kernel does:
     - various small but important networking fixes from Davem (thanks). One
       of them is the "anti-nagle" bit to allow programs that know what they
       are doing to avoid nagling by telling the kernel so. This is mainly
       things like Web servers and ftp-servers that can use this option
       together with "sendfile()".
     - scheduling timeout interface change: the new interface is much more
       logical than the old one, and allows us to get the jiffies wrap-around
       case right. Thanks to Andrea Arcangeli.
     - Various driver updates: specialix, sonycd,
     - Memory management fixups. Handle out-of-memory conditions correctly,
       and handle high memory load much more gracefully.
     - sparc and PowerPC architecture updates
     - 3c509 SMP fix, tlan PCI probe update.
     - scsi driver updates: ncr53c8xx, aic7xxx, dc390
     - filesystem updates: autofs, hfs, umsdos
    
    Go, test, be happy,

    I wonder why it wasn't GFP_USER - that's exactly what the thing is there
    for, and I don't know when it was changed. Probably with the new page
    cache or something. I just looked at the memory allocator, and it looked
    like it was doing the right thing, and it _was_ - but because it was
    called with GFP_KERNEL it tried harder than it should have to return a
    good page even when it ran out of memory.
    Anyway, I made a pre-patch-2.1.127-6 and put it on ftp.kernel.org (pre-4
    and pre-5 have been my internal pre-patches and don't show up there). This
    has the timeout code basic fixes and the mm fixes, and doesn't fall over
    for me with Andreas memory load case.

    Linux 2.1.127pre2
    
    I just found a case that could certainly result in endless page faults,
    and an endless stream of __get_free_page() calls. It's been there forever,
    and I bascially thought it could never happen, but thinking about it some
    more it can happen a lot more easily than I thought.
    
    The problem is that the page fault handling code will give up if it cannot
    allocate a page table entry. We have code in place to handle the final
    page allocation failure, but the "mid-way" failures just failed, and
    caused the page fault to be done over and over again.
    
    More importantly, this could happen from kernel mode when a system call
    was trying to fill in a user page, in which case it wouldn't even be
    interruptible.
    
    It's really unlikely to happen (because the page tables tend to be set up
    already), but I suspect it can be triggered by execve'ing a new process
    which is not going to have any existing page tables. Even then we're
    likely to have old pages available (the ones we free'd from the previous
    process), but at least it doesn't sound impossible that this could be a
    problem.
    
    I've not seen this behaviour myself, but it could have caused Andrea's
    problems, especially the harder to find ones. Andrea, can you check this
    patch (against clean 2.1.126) out and see if it makes any difference to
    your testing?
    
    (Right now it does the wrong error code: it will cause a SIGSEGV instead
    of a SIGBUS when we run out of memory, but that's a small detail).
    Essentially, instead of trying to call "oom()" and sending a signal (which
    doesn't work for kernel level accesses anyway), the code returns the
    proper return value from handle_mm_fault(), which allows the caller to do
    the right thing (which can include following the exception tables). That
    way we can handle the case of running out of memory from a kernel mode
    access too..
    
    (This is also why the fault gets the wrong signal - I didn't bother to fix
    up the x86 fault handler all that much ;)
    Btw, the reason I'm sending out these patches in emails instead of just
    putting them on ftp.kernel.org is that the machine has had disk problems
    for the last week, and finally gave up completely last Friday or so. So
    ftp.kernel.org is down until we have a new raid array or the old one
    magically recovers.  Sorry about the spamming.

    Linux 2.1.127pre1
    
    I have an alternate patch for low memory circumstances that I'd like you
    to test out.
    The problem with the old kswapd setup was at least partly that kswapd was
    woken up too late - by the time kswapd was woken up, it really had to work
    fairly hard. Also, kswapd really shouldn't be real-time at all: normally
    it should just be a fairly low-priority process, and the priority should
    grow as there is more urgent need for memory.
    This alternate approach seems to work for me, and is designed to avoid the
    "spikes" of heavy real-time kswapd activity during which the machine is
    fairly unusable in the old scheme.

    Linux-2.1.126
    
     - architecture updates for alpha and MIPS (and some minor PPC updates
       too)
     - joystick updates
     - MCA stuff from Alan. The guy has too much free time on his hands.
     - stallion driver cosmetic update
     - nasty SMP race with "task queues" (not the scheduling kind), where we
       were mixing atomic metaphores, resulting in a mess. Usually a benign
       one, but occasionally you could force oopses.
     - some floppy and ide updates
     - PS/2 mouse driver integrated into the PC keyboard controller. That got
       rid of a lot of really nasty problems (it's the same controller,
       accessing it from two different drivers was always messy)
     - various driver updates: floppy, ide, network drivers, sound, video..
     - various small FS fixes - finally _really_ getting the ENOENT vs ENOTDIR
       stuff right, nfsd updates, remounting fixes, filesize limits on NFS
       and smbfs, ntfs and ufs updates...
     - shm updates from Alan
     - cleanup of some MM stuff, I hope Andrea will re-do the patches and I'll
       look at the other parts.
     - unix fd garbage collection fix, getting rid of circular dependencies..
    
    And probably various other small fixes that I have thankfully forgotten
    about.

    Linux-2.1.125 ... pre-2.2 imminent
    
    It seems that I've finally found the mysterious bug that caused some SMP
    machines to lock up at bootup if they had no keyboard enabled. It turns
    out that the keyboard was a complete red herring, and that it just changed
    timings of bottom half handling in particular. The real culprit was some
    misguided locking attempts by the console driver at a really bad time.
    
    Anyway, that means that the last of my personal show-stopper bugs in 2.1.x
    seems to be finally history. I still expect to sync up with Alan Cox's
    patches in particular, but I'm mentally getting ready for a real 2.2.
    
    I still haven't decided on whether I'll make the same kind of "pre-2.2"
    that I did before the 2.0 release, but there are strong psychological
    reasons to do so to get people to more actively test it out with a "this
    really should be stable" mindset.
    
    In the meantime, there's now 2.1.125. Most of 2.1.125 is driver updates
    for various things, most notably perhaps joystick and the new 5.10 version
    of the Adaptec aic7xxx driver by Doug Ledford (but there are various other
    driver updates). The fix for the mysterious lock-up is a few embarrassing
    lines removed, but makes me feel a lot better ;)

    Linux-2.1.124...
    
    .. is out there now, and includes:
    
     - subtle fix for lazy FP save and restore on x86. The bug has been there
       for a long time, but was apparently triggered by the re-write of the
       low-level scheduling function. It could result in corrupted i387 state
       under certain (admittedly fairly unlikely) circumstances.
     - various networking updates. Some of the bugs fixed could result in
       kernel Oopses. None of them were common, though.
     - fixes for both filesystem accounting and quota handling.
     - the much-ado-about-little video driver merge.
     - PPC and Sparc updates
     - i386/SMP interrupt handling falls back on the safe mode.. Please tell
       me whether there are still machines with problems.
     - some new network drivers and updates
     - final (we hope) IP masquerade update
    
    I still have a problem with certain machines that apparently don't want to
    boot with the keyboard not plugged in even though they should. Kill me
    now. If you have problems with i386/SMP on a machine without a keyboard,
    plug one in and send me a report..

    This may or may not fix the APM problems, and the INITRD ones.  The
    INITRD one in particular was a case of a fairly inexplicable test that
    shouldn't have been there in the first place breaking when something
    completely unrelated was cleaned up..
    
    The APM breakage was simply due to it being in the wrong place.  The
    patch looks bigger than it really is - it really only moves the file to
    the proper directory, and makes sure that it should compile with the
    standard assembler..

    Linux 2.1.116
    
    I just released Linux-2.1.116. I've tested it fairly extensively on my SMP
    box, both with little memory and much, and I cannot make it lock up any
    more.
    
    Special thanks to Dean Gaudet who helped me set up a apache configuration
    that finally made me able to repeat the lockup, and made me able to debug
    the thing.
    
    Most of the 2.1.116 patches are "just" alpha and m68k updates, and can be
    ignored by most people. The bugfixes are, roughly:
    
     - fixed serious low-memory situation problem, where a critical resource
       allocation problem could result in nasy behaviour. Notably, doing TCP
       under low memory could result in TCP trying to allocate memory in a
       tight loop and locking out kswapd completely so that the situation
       would never be rectified. In short, the machine hung.
       This problem has been there forever, the only reason it doesn't show up
       under 2.0.x seems to be because under 2.0.x the TCP allocation was
       always for a single page, for which this situation never arises. Under
       2.1.x the slab code forced multi-page allocations.
       If you've seen lockups with 2.1.x, this may be the cause. This was what
       held up 2.1.116 for so long.
     - various minor driver updates. Networking, radio, bttv.
     - NFS over TCP still doesn't work, but at least it fails due to new
       reasons.
    
    Alan, try your squid thing under 2.1.116. I suspect it will hold up now,

    Linux-2.1.115 - code freeze.
    
    Ok, we've been in a tentative code freeze for a long time, and now it's
    final. I've made a 2.1.115 that I hope is good enough, and I won't be
    accepting anything but bug-fixes until 2.2..
    There are two long-standing patches that I'm still considering:
    
     - devfs
     - dynamic fd's
    
    and I kind of expect that they'll go in (devfs is configurable, so if you
    don't want it you don't need to care, and the dynamic fd's save some
    memory and speed certain things up a bit). The reason they're not in now
    is mainly that I've been trying to get everything else off my plate, and I
    want to ruminate on them in peace for a while.
    Bug-fixes are still (and will always be) accepted,

    What 2.1.110-3 does is to much more aggressively throw out dentries (and
    thus inodes) under low-memory circumstances.  It may be _too_ aggressive
    right now, but if so that just gives a good mid point to strive for.
    
    I'd really like to hear comments about how this "feels" (and numbers
    too, if you have them).  It's fairly hard for me to judge, as whenever I
    run Linux on small-memory machines it always feels slower than I'm used
    to, regardless of whether Linux does the right thing or not ;)

    Linux-2.1.109.. preliminary code freeze.
    
    Ok, it's out there now in all its glory...
    2.1.109 does the following thing:
    
     - CPU detection in C code (and thus much easier to expand upon,
       especially as it's all thrown away after booting now that it is
       "initfunc()").  This should finally get the Cyrix case right, for
       example. Please test.
     - too meny people convinced me that sendfile() really wants to act like
       writep().
     - sound driver updates from Alan.
     - console updates, so now we have the full old functionality again as far
       as I'm concerned (but I'm sure people will tell me something is still
       missing)
     - task switch and user space return cleanly handles bad segment
       descriptors etc, so people shoul dno longer be able to cause kernel
       messages by misusing the LDT (and I was just informed that you could
       actually completely hang a 2.1.x SMP kernel by doing nasty things -
       this fixes it)
     - wine should work again thanks to Bill Hawes (other LDT fixes)
     - de4x5 driver update
     - token ring driver update
     - ppp driver update
     - coda-fs update
     - "shared writable" bug fixed (thanks to a lot of people for testing and
       working on this - the actual fix was trivial once the problem was
       understood)
    
    In addition, I've spent a large part of my day running with a 12MB
    machine, and low-memory behaviour seems to be reasonable. People who have
    been unhappy with low-memory behaviour should check out 109 and comment on
    it - the heuristics are fairly different, and seem to be better.
    
    As of this release, I won't be looking at the "incoming" directory at the
    linux-patches site any more. I'll only be looking at "urgent" things, on
    the theory that I'm (a) lazy and (b) getting into code freeze.
    
    If you have important patches in "incoming", feel free to move them to
    "urgent". However, I will warn that if I don't consider them to be 2.2
    material, I'll just move them to "discarded".
    
    The same goes for patches in email. I will accept patches, but I've just
    raised the bar for acception.

    Linux 2.1.108
    
    I just made a pre-2.1.108 and put it on ftp.kernel.org - it fixes a
    problem where my sendfile() forgot to get the kernel lock (blush), so it
    randomly didn't work correctly on SMP.
    
    I've also done some more testing of sendfile(), and the nice thing is that
    when I compared doing a file copy with sendfile compared to a plain "cp",
    the sendfile implementation was about twice as fast (at least my version
    of "cp" will just do read+write pairs over and over again). When I copied
    a 38MB file the "cp" took 1:58 seconds while sendfile took 1:08 seconds
    according to "time" (I have 512MB of RAM, so this was all cached,
    obviously)..
    
    I haven't done any network tests, because I don't think I'd be able to see
    any difference, and it does need the "SO_CONSTIPATED" thing and a way to
    push the end of data for best performance.
    
    Some final words on sendfile():
     - it does report errors correctly. That doesn't mean that you necessarily
       can know _which_ fd produced the error, that you have to find out on
       your own. A file real access can generally result in EIO and EACCES
       (the latter with NFS and other "protection-at-read-time" non-UNIX
       filesystems), while the output write() can result in a number of errors
       as the output fd can be any kind of socket/tty/file. Depending on the
       mode of the output file, the output errors can include EINTR, EAGAIN
       etc, and you can mix sendfile() with select() on the output socket, for
       example.
     - you can give it a length of MAX_ULONG, and it will write as much as it
       can. This is entirely consistent with the notion that it is equivalent
       with write(out, tmpbuf, read(in, tmpbuf, size)) where "tmpbuf" is
       essentially infinite - the read() will read al of the file and return
       the file length in the process. Thus you don't even need to know the
       size of the file beforehand.
       The file copy test was essentially done with a single
            error = sendfile(out, in, ~0);
       and I'm appending my current test-program.
    
    This is going to be in 2.2, btw. The changes are so small and so obviously
    have to work that it would be ridiculous not to have this - the only
    question is whether I'll try to make it a "copyfd()" system call instead,
    falling back on read+write when I can't use the page cache directly. I
    suspect I won't.

    Linux 2.1.107pre2
    
    Are there people out there that use the loopback device with SMP, and have
    been irritated at it not working lately?
    I gave up on waiting for any real loop device maintainer to step up and
    fix this, so I made a very small patch that I suspect may fix the problem.
    I'm not going to test it myself, and I'm fairly disgusted with how badly
    the loop device is being maintained at all. But if people feel they want
    to test it out, go to
    
            ftp.kernel.org//pub/linux/kernel/testing
    
    and fetch the current pre-107-2 patch.
    It also has some other patches to the loop device that I picked up and
    that looked like the right thing to do (use dentry pointers instead of
    inodes to make mount/umount happy.

    [tytso] include/asm-i386/posix_types.h
    This quick fix eliminates a lot of warning messages when
    compiling e2fsprogs under glibc.  This is because the glibc header files
    defines its own version of FD_SET, FD_ZERO, etc., and so if you need to
    #include the kernel include files, you get a lot of duplicate defined
    macro warning messages.  This patch simply #ifdef's out the kernel
    versions of these function if the kernel is not being compiled and the
    glibc header files are in use.

    pre-104
    
    The bulk of the pre-patch is just some speeling error fixes, but there's a
    one-liner that gets rid of the double interrupts with level-triggered
    irq's on the IO-APIC, and that is known to have fixed one persons SCSI
    tape driver (the fact that there were problems with too many interrupts
    implies that something is slightly buggered in the driver, but..)
    
    This should also have a ne2000 driver that doesn't get a NULL pointer
    fault for some people, and the irq changes should hopefully make it work
    on UP systems again even if the kernel is compiled as SMP.
    And there are some MTRR updates.

    Ok, does it still work with 2.1.103?
    2.1.103 has this patch, and also changes certain other things wrt interrupts in
    a way that both Edgar and Ingo seem to agree on, and it's been stable on
    certain boxes where plain 2.1.102 wasn't.
    
    2.1.103 also disables the early Cyrix cpuid stuff, because we now seem to
    have confirmation that this is what corrupts DMA IDE transfers (the cyrix
    code steps on magic motherboard IO ports - which Intel probably put there
    specially to mess with Cyrix. But maybe I'm just cynical). So people that
    have had problems with disk corruption and are brave enough to try, this
    could be an interesting experiment.
    [ Thanks to Gerard Roudier and Alan Cox for chasing down the IDE
      corruption issue, btw ]

    pre-100 (on ftp.kernel.org now), moves the dcache shrinking into the regular
    memory de-allocation loop, and while the exact shrinking speed is probably
    completely off, it should be able to react much better to small-memory machines
    than the hardcoded shrink did..
    
    Also, for those that appear to still have SMP interrupt stability
    problems, Ingo pointed out that we may have problems with PCI
    level-triggered interrupts. Could those people please test an additional
    small patch that involves moving the "ack_APIC_irq();" inside
    arch/i386/kernel/irq.c: do_ioapic_IRQ() from the top of the function to
    the very bottom of that function (that will move it to outside the irq
    controller lock, but it should actually be perfectly ok in this case).

     - mtrr patches are there by default
     - all the irq fixes we know of to date are there (and hopefully even the
       ne2000 things should work with the SELF-IPI change)
     - various documentation updates and bugfixes (the best way to know that a
       stable kernel is approaching is to notice that somebody starts to

    in short, all known bugs should be fixed, but hey, what else is new?

    Linux 2.1.98
    
    I just released a fairly small patch to 97 to bring it up to 98.
    
    I've gotten a lot of patches in the mail for the last week, and I've been
    ignoring most of them for obvious reasons. They aren't in any in-queue,
    you can more-or-less consider them lost - but don't resend them all
    immediately, because if I get another huge batch of patches then I'll just
    have to ignore them again.
    
    We're going slow and easy, and the plan is to not only keep me sane in the
    midst of all the diapers, but I'll also at the same time take the
    opportunity to actually enforce the feature-freeze. You've known about it
    for a long time, _tough_.
    
    Anyway, 2.1.98 _should_ fix:
    
     - the IDE/SCSI lockups. The irq enable/disable code was broken, and could
       do some really bad things. This tended to lock up the machine if you
       accessed your IDE disks heavily, or in particular if you had a mixture
       of IDE and SCSI and used them at the same time. Tell me if you still
       have problems - I'm sure there are still bugs left, and I want to hear
       about them.
     - memory management especially on small-memory machines. I think I made a
       good change to the allocation logic, and I'm hoping it will fix the bad
       bahevaiour on those wimpy machines that all you losers out there are
       using that have less than half a Gig of RAM. It certainly still works
       fine on my machine, and I'm certainly still too lazy to test it out on
       anything smaller.
    
    There's a few other updates too: the asm constraints are fixed, so it
    should compile again with other compiler versions than the particular one
    I happen to be using. And some of the SCSI drivers have been updated a
    bit.
    
    There's been a lot of discussion and patches on capabilities, and I
    haven't applied them yet, I'll let them simmer a bit. Similarly, I've seen
    so many pathes to kmod that my head is spinning, and as I don't use
    modules myself I'd really like to get feedback from users about the
    different patches, so that maybe I'll get something that everybody can
    agree on as acceptable. Right now I don't know which patch I should even
    begin looking at.

    Linux 2.1.95
    
    This is finally the kind of feature-freeze patch I like: it only contains
    fixes for outright bugs. The fixes are:
     - SMP-safe disk drivers (more on this below)
     - various PCI fixes: /proc/bus/pci works again, and it should compile and
       work on Alpha with TGA.
     - parport interrupt detection uses the standard probe routines, and
       doesn't leave bogus "probe" entries hanging around to confuse people
       (and make other device registration fail)
     - the ever-popular PCI ne netdriver fix
     - the getcwd() system call works again.
     - "mb()" does the right thing on x86 too. Few drivers use it, but more of
       them should. Right now there are drivers that depend on luck making
       sure that the memory accesses will be in the same order outside the CPU
       as inside it.
    
    The conceptually big one is the SMP-safe disk driver change: it's not a
    very big patch, but it's fairly subtle. And it still requires help from
    the disk drivers themselves, although all of them should be safe in UP,
    and I made sure the BusLogic and the NCR driver are safe on SMP.
    The change is really a change in locking defaults: we used to default to
    no locking, and depended on the disk driver getting the locking right.
    None of them did so on SMP, for understandable reasons (there really
    wasn't any support for getting it right).
    
    The new default is to do the locking for the driver, and the driver
    actually has to do some work if it wants to do anything outside the lock.
    This has the obvious advantage that it _defaults_ to being safe, and
    people who know what they are doing can choose to thread the driver if
    they want to.
    
    The only change needed to drivers is to make sure they get the lock on an
    interrupt, which usually involves just doing the following around the
    low/level interrupt handler (the same handler that you register using
    "request_irq()"):
    
            void handle_irq(int irq, void *dev, struct pt_regs *regs)
            {
    +               unsigned long flags;
    +               spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock, flags);
                    ... call to the proper action routines ...
    +               spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock, flags);
            }
    
    which guarantees that everything inside the driver is correctly locked
    from the outside world (with the exception of ioctl's etc things that the
    driver traps - they need to be protected too).

    Linux 2.1.93
    
    2.1.93 is out there. It is broken on other platforms than x86, because I
    had to move some initialization code around, but this shoul dbe very easy
    to fix (moving the device init code later makes a _lot_ of things easier:
    the system is essentially up and running, and "kmalloc()" etc actually
    works).
    
    Now the PCI init code actually has the full SMP knowledge, which it needs
    in order to get the interrupt mapping stuff right (for example - it might
    eventually need it for other reasons too).
    
    The PCI code has generally been cleaned up - thanks to Martin Mares (the
    PCI cleanup is what forced me to do the other changes - anything else
    would simply have been too ugly).
    
    2.1.93 should also fix the stupid things in 92 (modules don't load due to
    missing symbols, and NULL pointer dereferences in /proc under certain
    circumstances etc).
    
    The kernel should also be better at detecting the really low memory
    circumstances, and eventually return NULL instead of just looping forever
    trying to find a page that it won't ever find.

    [tytso on ext2fs changes:]
    These patches provide the following enhancements to ext2.
            * Fixed a bug where we weren't byte-swapping the feature set
                    flags before checking EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_SPARSE_SUPER
            * Added Stephen Tweedie's patches to allow the number of file
                    blocks which will be preallocated to be tuned (instead
                    of being fixed at 8 blocks).
            * Added Stephen Tweedie's patches to allow directory blocks to
                    be preallocated.  This change is only activated if the
                    EXT2_FEATURE_COMPAT_DIR_PREALLOC is enabled.  (There
                    will soon be a new release of e2fsprogs that will
                    allow you to turn this on.)  The change is compatible
                    with older kernels (that's why it's a COMPAT feature),
                    but we need to flag it in the feature set because the
                    e2fsck needs a few changes to support this.
            * Added future support for B-trees in directories.  I have a
                    design in mind which is fully read/only compatible
                    with the existing ext2 directories, which will make
                    its debut in the 2.3 kernel series.  This patch will
                    allow 2.2 kernels to mount filesystems with B-tree
                    directories read-write; if a 2.2 kernel tries to
                    modify a B-tree directory, the B-tree valid bit will
                    be turned off, since the B-tree structures won't be
                    updated by 2.2 kernels.  2.0 kernels will be able to
                    mount filesystems with B-tree directories read-only.
                    This defines a new feature, EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_BTREE_DIR.
            * Added Jakub Jelinek's support for large files on 64-bit
                    platforms.  On a 64-bit platform, the first time you
                    expand a file past the 32-bit boundary, the
                    EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE is turned on.
                    2.0 machines will be able to mount such filesystems
                    read-only.  2.2 kernels on 32-bit platforms will be
                    able such filesystems read-write, but they will only
                    be able to see the first 2**32 bytes of the file, and
                    any attempt to open a large file for read/write access
                    will cause an EBIGF error.
            * Added support for storing the file type in the directory
                    entry.  This optimization was added to BSD 4.4 and
                    makes a very big difference for a number of
                    operations, since application programs can avoid doing
                    a stat in a number of situations.  Support for this is
                    in the GNU user-land utilities, and is in glibc
                    already.  Beyond this patch, we also need to implement
                    a new getdents system call that will return the
                    information all the way to libc.
                    The reason why it's important to get this change into
                    2.2 is that it requires "stealing" 8-bits from the
                    name_len field of the directory entry.  Ext2fs limits
                    you to 255 characters in a file name, so the high-byte
                    of name_len is always zero.  However, older kernels
                    look at both bytes of name_len, and will get confused
                    if we try to store something there.  So we can only
                    update the file type field if the feature
                    EXT2_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_FILETYPE is enabled.
                    I want to get this support into the 2.2 kernel, since
                    even if it isn't used much (because people will want
                    their filesystems to be compatible with 2.0 kernels),
                    we will be able to migrate smoothly to using this
                    feature by default in the future.

    Linux 2.1.92 - Feature Freeze
    
    Ok, there's a fairly large patch out there, but as of 2.1.92 I think we
    have a real feature-freeze, and we'll try to get a real code-freeze going
    soon. There are known problems with the sound drivers etc, which is why a
    code-freeze isn't the best suggestion right now, and there are probably
    still bugs with some of the new code, but I'll freeze new features for the
    upcoming 2.2 kernel.
    
    Yes, some people will scream bloody murder, but others will be relieved
    that it finally happened. Thanks especially to David Miller who has been
    doing a great job of getting the TCP stack from its problems just a few
    weeks ago to really shining new heights. That was my main worry about 2.2
    not all that long ago, and was the main reason for having such a slushy
    period for a while.
    
    2.1.92 does:
     - ISDN updates
     - alpha update (yes, SMP finally works, although not really stable yet)
     - networking fixes
     - "getcwd()" system call (not very long, the dcache makes this so
       trivial it is scary)
     - the mm responsiveness updates (they were in 2.1.92-pre2, people seemed
       to have found them very effective)
     - some other (mainly driver updates)
    
    Please do test it all out. Feature-freeze doesn't mean that it is supposed
    to be bug-free yet, but it does mean that we should be moving into
    bugfixing mode in quick order.
    And no, this is not an April 1 thing. But this way I can use April 1 as an
    excuse if something doesn't actually compile.

    I just put a pre-90 on ftp.kernel.org, and I'm happy to report that Davem
    seems to have found and fixed the TCP performance problem, which means
    that the code-freeze for 2.2 is going to go into effect shortly..
    
    pre-90 does a few other minor things, like for example getting rid of
    kerneld because the new kmod thing is a lot simpler in many ways. Let's
    see what the reaction to that is, but I'm fairly certain that this was a
    major good thing: I've personally never liked kerneld, but kmod seems to
    be a much nicer and more controlled way of handling the same issues that
    kerneld tried to do. I'd actually almost be willing to use the thing
    myself, something that was never true of kerneld.
    
    This also moves the WD7000 SCSI driver to a working status again, thanks
    to Miroslav Zagorac.
    
    But the interesting and important part of the patches are the networking
    fixes from David and Bill Hawes..

    It should fix the problem another way that I'm happier with (fixing that
    problem also revealed a few other misuses of close_fp() due to historical
    reasons - the uses really needed to be "fput()"s instead).
    2.1.89-4 also uses "struct file" for mmap's, which means that the problem
    that somebody was complaining about with mmap (that the mapping would
    exist even after the last "release()" on that file, and thus the file
    would still be active) are gone. As of -4 the kernel will guarantee that
    it will call the file->f_op->release() onle after there really aren't any
    uses of that file pointer any more..

    Stephen Tweedie:
    
    * 2.1.88, adds a bunch of new functionality to
      the swapper.  The main changes are:
    
    * All swapping goes through the swap cache (aka. page cache) now.
    
    * There is no longer a swap lock map.  Because we need to atomically
      test and create a new swap-cache page in order to do swap IO, it is
      sufficient just to lock the struct page itself.  Having only one
      layer of locking to deal with removes a number of races concerning
      swapping shared pages.
    
    * We can swap shared pages, and still keep them shared when they are
      swapped back in!!!  Currently, only private shared pages (as in pages
      shared after a fork()) benefit from this, but the basic mechanism will
      be appropriate for MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED pages too
      (implementation to follow).  Pages will remain shared after a swapoff.
    
    * The page cache is now quite happy dealing with swap-cache pages too.
      In particular, write-ahead and read-ahead of swap through the page
      cache will work fine (and in fact, write-ahead does get done already
      under certain circumstances with this patch --- that's essentially how
      the swapping of shared pages gets done).  Support code to perform
      asynchronous readahead of swap is included, but is not actually used
      anywhere yet.
    
      I've tested with a number of forked processes running with a shared
      working set larger than physical memory, and with SysV shared memory.
      I haven't found any problems with it so far.
    
    Linus: I've also changed the way we consider us to need more memory in kswapd,
           but that was entirely orthogonal and did not impact these patches. ]

    Linux 2.1.81pre1
    
    I just made a pre-2.1.81 available on ftp.kernel.org.
    This fixes the known problems of 2.1.80, and also makes the interrupt
    routing by default look like it always used to look - everything goes
    through the traditional external 8259A-compatible logic.
    The code to handle IO-APIC interrupt routing is still there, but as no
    interrupts are actually marked as io-apic interrupts you don't see it in
    action yet. The advantage of this is that people who want to work on this
    have a base that contains all the logic, and that we only need to figure
    out how to reliably make all the IRQ routing decisions.

commit 07e15ef7808e00b421b0996e338e863f79061c50 (Jan 20 1998)
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org>

    Linux 2.1.80
    
    This release should fix a few networking problems, and the NFS client is
    hopefully fairly stable even under the kinds of loads we have here at
    Transmeta.
    
    The 2.1.80 release also contains some initial ARM support, and contains
    Ingo Molnar's better SMP interrupt handling.
    
    NOTE NOTE NOTE! The new SMP interrupt handling is currently not very good
    at autodetection. This can be a real problem, and _before_ booting the
    2.1.80 kernel as compiled for SMP you should probably try to figure out a
    possible IRQ override line by doing:
    
            echo -n pirq=; echo `scanpci -f | grep T_L | cut -c56-` | sed 's/ /,/g'
    which for me gives
            pirq=0x00,0x09,0x0b
    
    Then, after doing the above, boot into 2.1.80 and see if it finds your PCI
    interrupt lines correctly. If it does, everything is fine. If it doesn't,
    you need to boot with the pirq setting that you determined earlier, by
    giving the kernel the pirq data at the bootup command line or by using the
    LILO "append=" feature (or similar features in other bootloaders).
    We'll certainly have to make the autodetection work reliably, but in the
    meantime the command-line approach at least gives us a way to test the
    more fundamental impacts of better interrupt handling.

    Pre-2.1.80..
    
     I just put a pre-2.1.80 on ftp.kernel.org that should fix the fat-related
    problems. The reason I put it there is because I got several patches that
    fixed the FAT problems _and_ something else, and they all obviously
    clashed with each other so neither part got applied.
    
     So I'd ask people who sent me patches to maybe re-send the parts of the
    patches that are still relevant,

    Linux 1.0
    
    CHANGES since 0.99 patchlevel 15:
    
    - removed all the bugs, of course.
    - networking fixes.
    - more changes than I really wanted..
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    Linux 1.0---A better UNIX than Windows NT
    
    Summary: Linux 1.0 released
    Keywords: Linux Kernel 1.0 Academy Awards
    X-Moderator-Added-Keywords: universe, end of
    
    Finally, here it is.  Almost on time (being just two years late is
    peanuts in the OS industry), and better than ever:
    
    	Linux kernel release 1.0
    
    This release has no new major features compared to the pl15 kernels, but
    contains lots and lots of bugfixes: all the major ones are gone, the
    smaller ones are hidden better.  Hopefully there are no major new ones.
    
    The Linux kernel can be found as source on most of the Linux ftp-sites
    under the names
    
    	linux-1.0.tar.gz		(full source)
    	linux-1.0.patch.pl15.gz		(patch against linux-0.99pl15)
    	linux-1.0.patch.alpha.gz	(patch from linux-pre-1.0)
    
    it should be available at least at the sites
    
    	ftp.funet.fi:
    		pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus	(now)
    	sunsite.unc.ed:
    		pub/Linux/Incoming		(now)
    		pub/Linux/kernel		(soon)
    	tsx-11.mit.edu:
    		pub/linux/sources/system	(soon)
    	ftp.cs.helsinki.fi:
    		pub/Software/Linux/Kernel	(now)
    
    This release finally moves Linux out of Beta status and is meant as a
    base for distributions to build on.  It will neither change Linux'
    status as FreeWare under the GPL, nor will it mean the end of
    development on Linux.  In fact many new features where held back for
    later releases so that 1.0 could become a well tested and hopefully
    stable release.
    
    The Linux kernel wouldn't be where it is today without the help of lots
    of people: the kernel developers, the people who did user-level programs
    making linux useful, and the brave and foolhardy people who risked their
    harddisks and sanity to test it all out.  My thanks to you all.
    (Editorial note: if you think this sounds too much like the Academy
    Awards ceremony, just skip this: it's not getting any better.)
    
    Thanks to people like Aaron Kushner, Danny ter Haar and the authors of
    the AnwenderHandbuch (and others) who have helped me with hardware or
    monetary donations (and to the Oxford Beer Trolls and others who took
    care of the drinkware).  And thanks to Dirk, who helped me write this
    announcement despite my lazyness ("hey, it's just another release, who
    needs an announcement anyway?").
    
    To make a long and boring story a bit shorter and boring, here is at
    least a partial list of people who have been helping make Linux what it
    is today.  Thanks to you all,

    in the networking.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.15 (February 2, 1994)
    
    sbpcd (Sound Blaster Pro CD interface) driver.
    
    Andries Brouwer cleans up and re-does keyboard driver diacritical handling.
    
    Lots of new sound drivers.
    
    Sysvfs added (Xenix, SystemV/386 and Coherent support).  Linux was
    starting to have a lot of users move over..
    
    MAP_ANONYMOUS flag added to mmap().
    
    Loadable modules added.
    
    Alan Cox is active in networking.
    
    [original changelog below]
    
    Linux 0.99.15 released: Codefreeze for 1.0
    
    People who look into my directory on ftp.funet.fi will already have
    noticed that the latest version of linux (0.99.15) is available, and I
    assume it will be available on most other linux sites soon.  As
    explained in a previous announcement, 0.99.15 is "it", in that this will
    be the base for 1.0 after about a month of testing.  No further patches
    are accepted until the 1.0 release, unless they obviously fix a serious
    bug.
    
    **** NOTE 1 ****
    
      For this code-freeze to be effective yet still potential bugs be
      found, testing is needed, along with good reports of errors and
      problems.  Thus, nobody should think "hey, the *real* release will be
      out in a month, let's wait for that", but instead think: "hey, I'd
      better test this one, so that the *real* release won't result in any
      ugly surprises for me".
    
      In short: test it out, preferably even more than you usually do.  Run
      "crashme" for the whole month if you have the CPU-power to spare,
      and/or just misuse your machine as badly as you can.  And if there are
      problems, report them to me (and the better the report, the more
      likely I am to be able to do something about it).
    
    **** NOTE 2 ****
    
      Bumping the linux version number to 1.0 doesn't mean anything more
      than that: it's only a version number change.  More explicitly, it
      does *NOT* mean that linux will become commercial (the copyright will
      remain as-is), nor does it mean that development stops here, and that
      1.0 will be anything special in that respect.
    
      I'm also afraid that just changing the version number will not make
      potential bugs magically disappear: this has been amply proven by
      various software houses over the years.  This code-freeze is there in
      order to avoid most of the problems that people sometimes associate
      with "X.0 releases", and I hope that it will mean that we have a
      reasonably stable release that we can call 1.0 and one that I won't
      have to be ashamed of.
    
      Ok, enough said, I hope.  The pl15 release is hopefully good, but I'll
      continue to make ALPHA patches against it along the whole month as
      problems crop up.  The networking code has been much maligned, and is
      not perfect by far yet, but it's getting its act together thanks to
      various developers and testers.  And as wiser men than I have said (or
      if they haven't, they should have):
    
          "There is life after 1.0"
    
      Any rumors that the world is coming to an end just because I'm about to
      release a 1.0-version are greatly exaggerated.  I think.
    
                        Linus
    
    ----------
    Things that remained the same between 0.99.14 and 0.99.15:
    
    - I again forgot to update the README before uploading the release.  In
      pl14, I talked about pl13, while the all new and improved README has
      now caught up with pl14.  Remind me to buy a new brain one of these
      days.
    
    Changes between versions 0.99.14 and 0.99.15:
    
     - improved Pentium detection.  Some of you may have had linux report
       your 4086DX2 as a pentium machine, but the new kernel will tell you
       the sad truth.  Whee.
     - Network driver updates by Donald Becker.  New drivers added, old ones
       updated.
     - FPU emulation updates by Bill Metzenthen.  Various minor errors and
       misfeatures fixed (mostly error handling).
     - Support for the SoubdBlaster Pro CD-ROM driver added by Eberhard
       Moenkeberg.
     - extended support for keyboard re-definition, along with font
       re-programming (Eugene Crosser, Andries Brouwer et al).
     - tty handling fixes: true canonical mode with most features supported
       by Julian Cowley.  This may make your canonical mode behave funnily
       if you happen to use old and broken programs that happened to work
       with the old and broken behaviour (this includes at least some
       'getty' programs).
     - serial driver changes and tty fixes by Theodore Ts'o.
     - SCSI fixes by Drew Eckhardt, Eric Youngdale, Rik Faith, Kai Mdkisara
       et al.
     - Updated sound card driver to version 2.4 (Hannu Savolainen)
     - COFF binary loading support (but you will still need the experimental
       iBCS2 patches to run non-linux i386 COFF binaries) by Al Longyear.
     - Upgraded ext2fs filesystem routines (0.4a -> 0.4b), with new
       features.  Read the fs/ext2/CHANGES file for details.  Remy Card and
       Stephen Tweedie.  Get a new fsck that knows about the new features.
     - pipe behaviour fixed in the presense of multiple writers (now
       actually conforms to POSIX specs about atomic writes).  Much of the
       code by Florian Coosmann.
     - minix filesystem extended to support the clean flag: get a new fsck
       that knows about it.
     - System V filesystem (support for Xenix, Coherent and SysV
       filesystems) by Doug Evans, Paul Monday, Pascal Haible and Bruno
       Haible.
     - loadable modules (various authors, don't remember original author of
       the "modules" code).
     - Lots of networking fixes by various people: Alan Cox, Charles
       Hedrick, me and various other people.  Non-byte-aligned networks
       work, and the networking code should be much stabler in general.
    
     + various bugfixes and enhacements here and there (mcd driver update by
       Jon Tombs, atixlmouse fix by Chris Colohan, /dev/full by XXX etc etc)
    
    All in all, the patches come out to 1.5MB uncompressed (about 400kB
    gzip-9'd), so there is little or no idea to make patches to plain pl14
    available.  Incremental patches and ALPHA-releases can be found on
    ftp.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/ALPHA-pl14.

    This is a general announcement of the imminent code-freeze that will
    hopefully make linux 1.0 a reality.  The plan has been discussed a bit
    with various developers already, and is already late, but is still in
    effect otherwise.
    
    In short, the next version of linux (0.99.15) will be a "full-featured"
    release, and only obvious bug-fixes to existing features will be applied
    before calling it 1.0.  If this means that your favourite feature or
    networking version won't make it, don't despair: there is life even
    after beta (and it's probably not worth mailing me about it any more:
    I've seen quite a few favourite features already ;-).
    
    In fact, 1.0 has little "real meaning", as far as development goes, but
    should be taken as an indication that it can be used for real work
    (which has been true for some time, depending on your definition of
    "real work").  Development won't stop or even slow down: some of it has
    even been shelved pending a 1.0 already.
    
    Calling it 1.0 will not necessarily make all bugs go away (quite the
    opposite, judging by some other programs), but I hope it will be a
    reasonably stable release.  In order to accomplish this, the code-freeze
    after 0.99.15 will be about a month, and I hope people will test out
    that kernel heavily, instead of waiting for "the real release" so that
    any potential bugs can be found and fixed.
    
    As to where we are now: as of this moment, the latest release is the 'r'
    version of pl14 (aka "ALPHA-pl14r").  I've made ALPHA releases available
    on ftp.funet.fi almost daily, and expect a final pl15 within a few more
    days.  Testing out the ALPHA releases is not discouraged either if you
    like recompiling kernels every day or two..
    
    And finally: we also try to create a "credits" file that mentions the
    developers of the kernel and essential linux utilities.  The credit file
    compilator is jmartin@opus.starlab.csc.com (John A. Martin), and if you
    feel you have cause to be mentioned in it, please contact him.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.13 (September 19, 1993)
    
    We get enable_irq()/disable_irq()
    
    The C++ experiment is not going well.  Get rid of the 'extern "C"', but
    replace it with an "asmlinkage" #define that allows us to experiment.
    
    ELF binary support it a notable change.
    
    Original ChangeLog:
    
     - the bad memory management one-liner bug in pl12 is naturally fixed.
     - compiled with plain C by default instead of C++
     - ELF binary support (Eric Youngdale)
     - Quickport mouse support (and some changes to the PS/2 mouse driver)
       by Johan Myreen and co)
     - core file name change ("core" -> "core.xxxx" where xxxx is the name
       of the program that dumped code).  Idea from ???.  Also, core-files
       now correctly truncate any existing core file before being written.
     - some mmap() fixes: better error returns, and handling of non-fixed
       maps for /dev/mem etc.
     - one kludgy way to fix the wrong arp packets that have plagued net-2d
       (resulting in arp packets that had the first four bytes of the
       ethernet address as the IP address).
     - I fixed the mount-point handling of 'rename()' and 'unlink()/rmdir()'
       so that they should now work and/or give appropriate error messages.
       An early version of this patch was already sent to the KERNEL
       channel, which fixed the rename problem but not a similar bug with
       unlink.
     - packet mode fixes by Charles Hedrick.  Sadly, these are likely to
       break old telnet/rlogin binaries, but it had to be done in order to
       communicate correctly with the rest of the world.
     - FPU emulator patches from Bill Metzenthen.  The fprem1 insn should be
       correct now (not that anybody seems to have seen the incorrect
       behaviour..)
     - a few fixes for SCSI (Drew and Eric)
     - signal.c changes to handle multiple segments (for Wine) correctly.
     - updated drivers from Donald Becker: 3c509 and AT1500 drivers, but
       also some other drivers have been edited, and some networking fixes.

    Very small patch to 0.99pl12
    
    I hate to put out patches this soon after a release, but there is one
    potentially major problem in pl12 which is very simple to fix..  I'm
    including patches: both in plain ascii and as a uuencoded gzip file
    (it's the same patch - the uuencoded one is in case there is any
    newsserver that messes up whitespace).
    
    The main patch is just the change from __get_free_page(GFP_BUFFER) into
    get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL), and the two minor patches just add checks
    that actually enforce the read-only nature of current file mmap'ings so
    that any program that tries to do a write mapping at least will be told
    that it won't work.
    
    I'd suggest anybody compiling pl12 should add at least the file_table.c
    patch: thanks to Alexandre Julliard for noticing this one.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.12 (August 14, 1993)
    
    CDU31A and MCD CD-ROM drivers.  Ahh, the bad old days of every sound
    card manufacturer having their own CD interface.
    
    Much nicer keymaps for keyboards.
    
    Many more network drivers by Donald Becker for the improving NET-2 code.
    
    Eric Youngdale makes executables and libraries use the new mmap()
    functionality.  The old special-cased sharing goes away.  Hurray! This
    also means that mmap gets a lot more testing.  It also means that NFS
    has to be fixed to allow mmaps. Done.
    
    "sys_modify_ldt()" appears, the extended DOS emulators want it.
    
    Still using C++ to compile the kernel.
    
    Original changelog:
    
     - The memory manager cleanup has continued, and seems to be mostly
       ready, as proven by the ease of adding mmap() over NFS with the new
       routines.  So yes, the pl12 kernel will demand-load your binaries
       over NFS, sharing code and clean data, as well as running shared
       libraries over NFS.  Memory management by Eric and me, while the NFS
       mmap code was written by Jon Tombs,
    
     - ** IMPORTANT **: The keyboard driver has been enhanced even further,
       and almost everything is completely re-mappable.  This means that
       there is a new version of 'loadkeys' and 'dumpkeys' that you must use
       with this kernel or you'll have problems.  The default keyboard is
       still the US mapping, but if you want to create your own mappings
       you'll have to load them with the new binaries.  Get the 'kbd.tar.gz'
       archive from the same place you get the kernel.
    
       The new keymappings allow things like function key string changes,
       remapping of the control keys, and freedom to remap any of the normal
       keyboard functions: including special features like rebooting,
       console switching etc.  The keyboard remapping code has been done
       mostly by Risto Kankkunen (Risto.Kankkunen@Helsinki.FI).
    
     - updated network drivers by Donald Becker
    
     - updated serial drivers - tytso@Athena.mit.edu
    
     - updated 387 emulation (Bill Metzenthen).  The updated emulator code
       has more exact trigonometric functions and improved exception
       handling.  It now behaves very much like a real 486, with only small
       changes (greater accuracy, slightly different denormal NaN handling
       etc - hard to detect the differences even if you are looking for
       them).
    
     - network timer fixes by Florian La Roche (much cleaned up net/inet/timer.c
       and some bad race-conditions fixed).
    
     - Scsi code updates by Eric Youngdale and others
    
     - Sony CDU-31A CDROM driver by Corey Minyard added to the standard
       kernel distribution.
    
     - The Mitsumi CDROM driver is now part of the standard kernel.  Driver
       by Martin Harriss with patches by stud11@cc4.kuleuven.ac.be (yes, he
       probably has a real name, but no, I haven't found it) and Jon Tombs.
    
     - various other minor patches (preliminary ldt support etc)

    PATCH: fork.c bug in 0.99.pl11
    
    There is at least one known problem with 0.99pl11 - it's very minor and
    will not lead to any real problems, but it's also very easy to fix,
    so...
    
    The problem is a one-liner oversight in kernel/fork.c (thanks to TjL for
    noticing the symptoms - they aren't easy to see), which is fixed by the
    following patch:
    
    In fact, it's probably easiest to "apply" this patch by hand: just
    change the "p->tss.fs = KERNEL_DS" in fork.c to "p->tss.fs = USER_DS"
    and you should be fine.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.11 (July 17, 1993)
    
    Real file mmap with page sharing in the VM code.  We don't do writable
    shared mappings (and we won't do them for a _long_ time yet), but this
    is a big step forward!
    
    Note in the COPYING file that the GPL only covers the kernel, not user
    programs. People were starting to find Linux more and more interesting..
    
    Improved configure script.
    
    Use nicer "save_flags()/cli()/restore_flags()" macros instead of
    hardcoding the inline assembly.  Clean up other inline assembly usage
    too.
    
    Trying to compile the kernel with C++ compiler.  It will be a failed
    experiment.
    
    Original ChangeLog:
    
     - The keyboard is dynamically changeable (this is true of pl10 as
       well), and you need to get the "keytables.tar.z" archive to set the
       keyboard to suit your taske unless you want to live with the default
       US keymaps.
    
       Use the "loadkeys map/xxx.map" command to load the keyboard map: you
       can edit the maps to suit yourself if you can't find a suitable one.
       The syntax of the keyboard maps should be obvious after looking at
       the examples.
    
     - The memory manager has been cleaned up substantially, and mmap()
       works for MAP_PRIVATE.  MAP_SHARED is still not supported for
       anything else than /dev/mem, but even so it actually is usable for a
       lot of applications.  The shared library routines have been rewritten
       to use mmap() instead of the old hardcoded behaviour.
    
     - The kernel is now compiled with C++ instead of plain C.  Very few
       actual C++ features are used, but even so C++ allows for more
       type-checking and type-safe linkage.
    
     - The filesystem routines have been cleaned up for multiple block
       sizes.  None of the filesystems use it yet, but people are working on
       it.
    
     - named pipes and normal pipes should hopefully have the right select()
       semantics in the presense/absense of writers.
    
     - QIC-02 tape driver by Hennus Bergman
    
     - selection patches in the default kernel
    
     - fixed a bug in the pty code which led to busy waiting in some
       circumstances instead of sleeping.
    
     - Compressed SLIP support (Charles Hedrick). See net/inet/CONFIG
    
     - the 'clear_bit()' function was changed to return the previous setting
       of the bit instead of the old "error-code".  This makes use of the
       bit operations more logical.
    
     - udelay() function for short delays (busy-waiting) added.  Used
       currently only by the QIC driver.
    
     - fork() and sheduler changes to make task switches happen only from
       kernel mode to kernel mode.  Cleaner and more portable than the old
       code which counted on being able to task-switch directly into user
       mode.
    
     - debugging malloc code.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.10 (June 7, 1993)
    
    People finally gave up on net-1, Ross Biro grew tired of the flames, and
    net-2 appears with Fred van Kempen as maintainer.  This is the big
    switch-over version.
    
    fsync() isn't just a stub any more, and System V IPC is also showing up.
    
    The "struct file" filetable is made dynamic, instaed of a static
    allocation.  For the first time you can have _lots_ of files open.
    
    Stub for iBCS2 emulation code.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    I've finally released an official version of linux-0.99 patchlevel 10:
    there have been various alpha versions floating around which differ in
    details (notably networking code), which shouldn't be used any more.
    The new linux version is available only as full source code: the diffs
    would have been too big to be useful.  You can find linux-0.99.10.tar.z
    (along with keytables.tar.z) on nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus
    and probably on tsx-11 and other linux archives within a day or two (so
    check there first if you are in the states).
    
    Linux-0.99 pl10 has a number of new features and changes in interface.
    The most notable of these are:
    
     - the networking code is reorganized (generally called "net-2",
       although unrelated to the BSD release).  The new code implements a
       lot of standard features lacking in net-1, and also changes the user
       interface to be closer to the BSD standards.  Notably, the old
       configuration binaries won't work, so to get the new networking to
       work you'll have to get the net-2 binaries as well.  The networking
       binaries are available on tsx-11.mit.edu (and mirrors) under the
       directory pub/linux/packages/net/net-2 (and the setup syntax has
       changed somewhat..)
    
       The networking code has been mainly organized and rewritten by Fred
       van Kempen, with drivers by Donald Becker.
    
     - serial line setup has been changed: linux 0.99 pl10 does *not* try to
       autodetect serial ports very agressively.  If you have other serial
       ports than the standard com1/com2, or nonstandard IRQ etc values,
       this means that it's less likely to work without any help.  The
       solution is not to recompile the kernel - you should get the
       "setserial" program available from tsx-11.mit.edu in the directory
       pub/linux/sources/sbin/setserial-2.01.tar.z that allows you to
       dynamically configure your serial ports to suit your setup.
    
       The main organizer behind the serial line changes is tytso (Theodore
       Ts'o).
    
     - Keyboard setup has changed: it is no longer hardcoded at compile
       time, but instead you can use the new "loadkeys" program to load in a
       new keyboard map on the fly.  The default keyboard map is the normal
       US keyboard (yes, I should have used the Finnish one by default, but
       after thinking of all the problems that would have resulted in I
       forgot about that idea).  The loadkeys code can be found in the
       "keytables.tar.z" archive, which also contains keymaps for most
       normal keyboard types.  To create a custom keyboard table is very
       easy - just take a 5 minute look at the existing map files (they
       resemble the ones used by xmodmap, so if you are familiar with
       those..)
    
       The loadable keymaps were mostly implemented by Risto Kankkunen.
    
    There are a lot of other internal kernel changes, but they should be
    mostly transparent, and noticeable only indirectly due to new features
    or (hopefully) better/faster/whatever operation.  These include:
    
     - the SysV IPC patches are in by default: Krishna Balasubramanian.
       If you need these, you know what it's about (notably, dosemu 0.49
       wants them).
     - inode handling is updated: inodes and files are now dynamically
       allocated within the kernel, and use a hash table for faster lookup
       (along with a NFU algorithm for the inode cache).  Steven Tweedie.
     - Updated FPU emulation: mostly exception handling changes, making the
       emulator handle most exceptions the same way a 486 does.  The
       emulator is written by Bill Metzenthen.
     - a few ext2-fs updates by Remy Card and Steven Tweedie.
     - support for the 'fsync()' function (Steven Tweedie)
     - various (minor) SCSI patches to catch some error conditions, add
       support for VLB adaptec controllers without DMA and so on (different
       people).
     - other changes - I forget.
    
    In addition to patches sent in by others, I've naturally made my own
    changes (often *to* the patches sent in by others :-).  Among other
    things, the pl10 buffer cache code now also tries to share pages with
    executables, resulting in better cacheing especially of binaries (giving
    noticeable improvements in kernel recompilation speed on some machines).
    Also, I've changed a lot of low-level things around to help the iBCS2
    project: this includes things like internal segment handling and the
    signal stack (which now looks the same as on SysV i386 unixes).  All in
    all, pl10 has a disturbing amount of new code, but will hopefully work
    well despite (due to?) the number of changes.
    
    The new networking code in particular will change the network setup a
    lot - it now looks more standard, but if you were used to the old way of
    doing things..  On the other hand, most people actively using the
    networking features have hopefully gotten warnings about this on the NET
    channel for the last few weeks.  Also, the networking code still isn't
    perfect: Fred is still working on it, but it seems to have reached a
    reasonably stable platform on which it will be easier to build.  Look
    out for the new-and-improved networking manual, hopefully out soon(?).
    
    Standard request: please try it all out, give it a real shakedown, and
    send comments/bug-reports to the appropriate place (I'm always
    appropriate, but you may want to send the report to the mailing lists
    and/or the newsgroup as well).  I apologize for the lateness of the
    release (forcing hlu to make interim gcc releases that relied on
    nonstandard kernels etc), and the changes are somewhat bigger than I'd
    prefer, so the more testerts that try it out, the faster we can try to
    fix any possible problems.  The new kernel has gone through various
    stages of ALPHA-diffs and some late ALPHA-pl10's, so there shouldn't be
    any major surprises, but alpha releases tend not to get even close to
    the coverage a real release gets...

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.9 (April 23, 1993)
    
    Bill's math emulator now passes paranoia.
    
    Last argument to ioctl is "long".
    
    sys_clone() appears.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    The latest kernel release is 0.99.9, and can be found on nic.funet.fi:
    pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus, both as patches relative to pl8 and as full
    sources.  The only major new feature is that the ST-0x driver has
    finally been updated to the scatter-gather code: ST-0x users should with
    luck get about 5 times the performance on disk-operations..  Seagate
    code written by Drew Eckhardt.
    
    0.99.9 also fixes:
    - the FPU-emulator should now handle all rounding-modes correctly, and
      pass all the paranoia package tests.  Patches by Bill Metzenthen.
    - bootup enhancements by Chrisoph Niemann (but the SVGA mode numbers
      have changed, so you may have to edit your lilo configuration file
      and/or the main Makefile to get the mode you normally want)
    - ext2fs updated to the very latest release.  Code by Remy Card and
      Stephen Tweedie.
    - various minor patches, some of them cosmetic, some of them fixes to
      smaller bugs..  Thanks to everybody who sent them in (even though not
      all made it)
    
    It might be a good idea to test it all out,

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.8 (April 8, 1993)
    
    Mount root filesystem read-only (conditional for now).
    
    SCSI updates.
    
    Stephen Tweedie shows up in ext2, with an enhanced block allocator.
    
    Signal handling update with generated code on the stack and a
    "sigreturn" system call.  This was needed to maintain compatibility in
    the face of a changed stack layout.  sigsuspend() also works correctly now.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    Yet another kernel release is now available on nic.funet.fi in the usual
    place (pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus for those of you that have already
    forgotten), and will probably show up on the other ftp-sites within a
    day or two.  There are two new files:
    
     linux-0.99.8.tar.z - the full gzipped and tarred source-tree of the
       linux kernel.
    
     linux-0.99.patch8.z - unified diffs against the last official release
       (0.99pl7).
    
    There is no SLIP or new networking routines in this kernel despite the
    rumors that have been flying around - the main changes to 0.99.7 are
    (some of them were in 0.99pl7A as well):
    
    - the signal handling code has been extensively reworked, and should be
      POSIX as well as clean.
    - dosfs is upgraded to version 12 (Werner Almesberger)
    - xiafs is upgraded to the latest version (Qi Xia)
    - ext2fs is upgraded to the latest version (Remy Card/Stephen Tweedie)
    - FPU-emulation patches for v86 mode and precision rounding (Bill
      Metzenthen)
    - SCSI patches by various people (Eric Youngdale & co)
    - XT harddisk support (Pat Mackinlay)

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.7A (March 21, 1993)
    
    More net-1 work. It's endless.
    
    XT harddisk support by Pat Mackinlay.
    
    sys_fsync() and SysV IPC code sys_ipc() stubs appear.
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    I don't generally announce ALPHA-diffs to quite this large an audience,
    but I'll be partying^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hunavailable for the rest of the
    week, and it's unlikely that I will be able to check mails or the
    newsgroups until the start of April.  As a result, I'm putting up my
    latest kernel version for ftp as it fixes some things in 0.99.7.
    
    The ALPHA-diffs can be found on nic.funet.fi: in the directory
    pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus.  If you dislike patching, you can get the
    full sources in "linux-0.99.7A.tar.z", or just get the diff file
    "ALPHA-diff.z".
    
    Changes in this release:
    - the new kernel now detects the lock-up condition at startup if you
      have a faulty 386/387 coupling, and will use software floating point
      in that case.
    - the Xia filesystem is updated to the latest version
    - the DOS filesystem is updated to the latest version
    - the XT disk driver is included: I haven't been able to test it, but
      at least it won't bother anybody if you don't configure it in..
    - the latest serial diffs are in
    - minor ultrastor fixes
    - some changes to the keyboard and line printer drivers: I hope the
      keyboard lockups that some people have reported would be gone with
      this release.
    - some fixes to arp.c
    
    I'll be interested in success/failure reports, although I won't be able
    to answer them for some time (and I might miss some of the posts on
    c.o.l).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.7 (March 13, 1993)
    
    Nigel Gamble makes lp driver able to use interrupts.
    
    The mmap() code is finally starting to really happen.  In particular,
    this means that "verify_area()" is doing more - it can check the actual
    areas that have been mapped, rather than just blindly assume that the
    user can access anything in the first 3GB.
    
    For now, the mmap code only does anonymous mappings and /dev/mem.
    Executables are still read into memory.  But the infrastructure is
    there.
    
    The VFS layer stops using names directly in user space - the race
    conditions were just too hard to handle.  So pathnames are copied into
    kernel space before they are looked up.
    
    Ext2fs (Remy Card) and xiafs (Frank Xia) are merged.  Both are much
    faster filesystems using bitmaps rather than freelists, and can handle
    big disks and big files.
    
    Ext2fs is based on extfs, while xiafs is a simpler straightforward
    extension of the old minixfs.
    
    Xiafs obviously was eventually dropped.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    It has been two weeks since the last release, so it's high time you
    should once more enjoy the pleasures of patching up your kernel to a
    higher version number if you are into those kinds of perversions.  Linux
    0.99pl7 is available as both full source and diffs against pl6 on
    nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus, and it will probably show up on
    the other major sites within days.
    
    As of pl7, I'm trying out a new format: both the full distribution and
    the diffs are now compressed with gzip as it is now available at most
    machines.  Also, the diffs are no longer context diffs: they use the
    smaller unified diff format.  At least the stock SunOS 'patch' binary
    seems not to understand them at all, but GNU patch has no problems, and
    unified diffs are a bit smaller (not that it matters much after gzip has
    done its deed on them).
    
    As to the changes in pl7: they are many and varied, and hopefully all to
    the better (-"Dream on Linus" -"Shut up").  Short list follows, hope I
    haven't forgotten anything major.
    
     - ext2fs is in: note that this is version 0.2c and that if you are
       currently using an older version there are some changes.  Small
       filesystems (< 256MB) should reportedly be automatically converted,
       bigger filesystems need some assistance. Ext2fs written by Remy Card.
     - xiafs is also in: again, the final version uses a slightly different
       layout to support exact file block counts, so if you use the xiafs,
       you should make sure you have the latest fs-tools.  Xiafs written by
       Frank Xia.
     - updated Ultrastor SCSI driver with scatter/gather by Scott Taylor.
       It should be much faster, as well as support the Ultrastor-34F.
     - major changes in the memory manager.  Yours truly got carried away,
       and finally cleaned up the mm layer due to pmacdona wanting mmap() on
       /dev/zero.  This means that the IPC patches won't go in, and need
       updating.  Krishna?
     - more big changes: I rewrote most of the VFS filename-handling.
       Filenames are copied into kernel space before being used, which
       cleaned things up somewhat, as well as simplifying some race-
       condition handling.  As a result, I was also able to easily expand
       the minix fs to cover the "linux" fs that some people have been using
       (same layout, but with 30-character names).
     - updated the printer driver: Nigel Gamble.  It is now able to use
       interrupts, although the default behaviour is still to poll.
     - serial driver updates by tytso (but no SLIP yet)
     - various minor patches for POSIX compliace: Bruce Evans, Rick Sladkey
       and me.
     - other minor patches all over the place: scsi, tcpip etc.
    
    All in all, the patches are almost half a megabyte even as unified
    diffs: getting the full sources might be easier than patching it all up.
    
    As always, some of the patches are actually tested by me, some aren't
    (and just because I wrote some of them doesn't mean I actually *tested*
    them: I have no idea if mmap() works on /dev/zero, although it should).
    I have neither a printer nor an Ultrastor controller, and I haven't got
    the diskspace to test out the new filesystems, so I can only hope they
    work "as advertized".  If you have problems, I want to hear about them,
    so keep the reports coming, and try to pinpoint the problem as well as
    you can ("when I do *this* it happens every time..").

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.6 (February 21, 1993)
    
    Merge a lot of duplicated special file handling into fs/devices.c, and
    make drivers register their major numbers properly.
    
    VFS layer gets fsync virtual function.
    
    Compressed image boot, with the kernel loaded into high memory..
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    I'm starting soon to run out of patchlevel numbers for 0.99, but I made
    a new release anyway (and long-time linux hackers remember my less than
    completely logical numbering: when I run out of numbers I'll start using
    alphabetical characters and other fun characters to indicate new
    versions :-)
    
    0.99pl6 is mainly a syncronization release: it fixes a few bugs and
    changes the behaviour of 'vhangup()' to be more standard.  The vhangup()
    changes will break some init/login stuff that depended on the earlier
    incorrect behaviour - not everybody may want to use pl6 until you are
    sure your init/login will work happily with it.  Better do these things
    before 1.0 than to break it later.
    
    Patchlevel 6 also changes the vfs functions for special devices as well
    as adding a 'fsync' field to the inode-operations structure.  Thus
    ext2fs and xfs need updating.  Remy and Xia? The special file and fifo
    handling code is no longer supposed to be in the fs-dependent layer, but
    is handled by the vfs routines, as it's the same for all "normal"
    filesystems.
    
    Ok, here are the actual changes/features of pl6:
    - the kernel can be loaded in gzipped format and de-compressed at
      startup beyond the 1MB mark.  Good for bootable rootdisks.  Patches
      mainly by Hannu Savolainen.
    - I finally enabled NMI's everywhere (except at the bootup sequence),
      so if you have memory errors, they will hopefully now result in
      kernel messages ("NMI received..")
    - the device registration code for special devices.  Special files are
      now registered with a special "register_[chr|blk]dev()" function.
    - consolidated fifo/special dev handling
    - vhangup patches.  Note that these may break init/login badly, at
      least if you are using poeigl-1.7.  Be careful that you don't get
      totally locked out of your machine.
    - the procfs NULL-dereferencing bugfix (michaelkjohnson)
    - literal next character handling (very losely based on a patch I
      received: I essentially rewrote it with final fixes by jrs).
    - fpu-emu bugfixes by Bill Metzenthen - fixes the "internal error 112"
      bug as well as a sign bug with zero.
    - fdomain driver fixes
    - various other minor fixes (wrongly replying to bad ip messages etc)
    
    I'm still not sure about the 387 error detection code: I have had a
    couple of messages that would suggest that some early clone 387's have
    problems with math exceptions in protected mode.  With the new (as of
    99pl5) test at startup this can lead to problems at boot-time.  Please
    mail me directly if you seem to have problems with this (it should be
    obvious in pl6 due to debugging messages at startup).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.5 (February 9, 1993)
    
    net-1: more fixes, use bottom halves for transmitting, more "volatiles"
    to hide bugs. /proc interfaces for networking.
    
    Side note: it took networking a _long_ time to recover from the
    volatiles.  Getting the locking right rather than trying to make the
    compiler make races smaller was a hard idea to get through.
    
    Bill Metzenthen moves his math emulator to "beta 1.0" status.
    
    Fred van Kempen shows up: starting to do a SLIP line discipline for tty
    devices.
    
    Verify FP exception handling.

    Only complete newbies don't know what this is all about, but I'd better
    tell you anyway: patchlevel 5 of the 0.99 kernel is now available on
    nic.funet.fi (pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus) as both context diffs against
    pl4 and complete source code.  I'm not even going to speculate on 1.0
    right now.
    
    The pl5 diffs are about 90kB compressed: the major changes are to the
    tcp/ip code and the serial driver, while there are various minor fixes
    strewn around the system:
    
     - serial lines/tty changes (tytso & Fred v Kempen)
     - NFS bugfixes (Rick Sladkey)
     - tcp/ip (Ross Biro)
     - coprocessor handling changes (me)
     - harddisk driver error handling (Mika Liljeberg)
     - various minor patches (me and others)
    
    Serial lines now implement non-blocking opens correctly and support
    dial-out lines (same minor, major==5).  I changed the default startup
    mode to be CLOCAL so that people won't get confused by the modem line
    code when not using dial-in.
    
    Another interesting change is the 387 error-coupling tests at bootup:
    the code to check if the intel-recommended exception 16 error reporting
    is present is "non-obvious".  If you have had problems with coprocessor
    error handling, or have a non-intel coprocessor, I'd suggest you test
    this out: I'd like to hear about problems/successes.
    
                    Linus
    
    PS.  If you tested out the latest ALPHA-diffs (the ones that already
    changed the kernel version to pl5), the changes to the final pl5 were
    only cosmetic.

    Get pl4, and it should be gone.  There was a bug in the handling of
    uninitialized interrupts in pl3, where they could result in either the
    wrong interrupt mask being loaded leading to interrupt lock-out or (in
    some cases) bit corruption at the user level.  The symptoms are exactly
    as you describe: a good interrupt that didn't happen to be locked out
    will correct the interrupt mask, and the system goes on (it can be
    moving the mouse, but it might also be a keyboard event etc).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.3 (January 13, 1993)
    
    VFS gets "permission()" virtual function.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Still no 1.0 - I have had a couple of reports of problems, so I'll make
    yet another 0.99 release.  The diffs (against 0.99.2) and complete
    source can be found at nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus as usual,
    and will probably show up at the other sites pretty soon.
    
    0.99.3 contains no real new features, but the diffs are pretty big
    anyway (100kB+ compressed): various things have moved around a bit and
    there are a lot of minor changes.  The changes include (but are not
    limited to):
    
     - the math emulator code now also understands the unofficial codes (in
       case somebody followed the ML math emulator thread).  I'd be
       interested to hear whether ML now works with the emulator.
     - various SCSI driver changes
     - some re-organization of the tty open/close code to remove a few race
       conditions.
     - interrupt handling rewrites (two-level interrupt code cleanups)
     - the serial drivers are tytso's alpha-drivers: they aren't quite
       completed, but as they need the interrupt handling patches to get
       ready, this is probably the least traumatic way of doing it.
     - some more minor keyboard driver changes (mostly taking advantage of
       the two-level interrupts)
    
    + a lot of other minor changes.  I once more hope people will try it
    out, and report any problems or successes to me.
    
    Known problems:
     - there seems to be something weird going on in the ST-0x driver with
       some scsi disks.
     - tcp/ip is reportedly still not quite stable, and I can't even test it
       out.
    
    NOTE! The DMA functions have changed for the high DMA channels - all DMA
    functions now take their arguments as the number of bytes instead of the
    old way of using bytes for ch 0-3 and words for ch 5-7.  This might lead
    to problems with the SoundBlaster driver, which may need editing.

    Bottom half race condition fix.
    
    Return ENODEV for nonexistent special devices.
    
    Fix Unix domain sockets to properly check for target equality.
    
    Add 'wchan' to /proc/stat
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Yes, as you've probably noticed, it's now 1993 and I still haven't
    released 1.0.  Sorry about that, and I have only another patchlevel to
    offer.  The new kernel should mainly fix some of the keyboard problems
    people have experienced, but does contain some other minor fixes.
    
    Linux 0.99.2 is available now at nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus
    as both sources and diffs against 0.99.1 the diffs are essentially the
    same as the second alpha-diffs I released for limited testing, with only
    minor fixes to fs/exec.c and fs/open.c.
    
    Please try out 0.99.2: the more feedback (hopefully positive) I get on
    it, the faster 1.0 will be out.
    
    Changes from pl1 are mainly:
     - pretty much rewritten low-level keyboard handling IO - this time
       actually trying to do it by the book.  It now handles resend requests
       from the keyboard etc.
     - you can run executables from filesystems without bmap support.  This
       mainly means NFS and msdos.  Note that while it's possible, it's
       slower and less memory-efficient than using a "normal" linux
       filesystem, and should generally be avoided.
     - /proc filesystem changes: /proc/kmsg can be used to log the kernel
       messages under X11 (instead of using the older system call to do the
       same), and there are changes to the statistics routines (WCHAN).
    
    + various minor fixes (non-existent devices are handled better, some
    changes to socket bind behaviour etc).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99.1 (December 21, 1992)
    
    Patch 1 addresses the following problems:
     - configuration. Hope there are no silly problems left..
     - inode.c: initialization changes (the missing NULL and some other
       minor fixes).
     - some SCSI tape driver patches (Kai M{kisara)
     - tcp/ip patches (Ross Biro, some code by me)
     - keyboard patches (mainly changed initialization - hope the keyboard
       lockups are gone).
     - completed /proc-fs: it should now contain all info needed by 'ps'
       (Micheal K Johnson).
     - various minor fixes (the minix-fs link overflow checking etc)
    
    Patch1 also contains support for extended VC switching - this is for the
    upcoming X11 that understands VC's.  One result of this is that console
    redirection now redirects *only* messages actually sent to /dev/console
    (aka /dev/tty0), not just to any foreground VC.  Wait for Xfree-1.2 to
    be able to switch VC's while under X (yes, including several X-sessions
    active at the same time..).
    
    I hope there are still people out there that aren't too busy stuffing
    themself with turkey to try out a new kernel release.  There is just
    over a week left of this year, and I need feedback in order to be able
    to release 1.0.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.99 (December 13, 1992)
    
    net-1: paranoid queue checking to find more bugs.
    
    configuration script version #1.
    
    NFS filesystem client support by Rick Sladkey!
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    0.99 has no major new features: the NFS client code is now in the
    standard distribution, and the kernel configuration has changed, but
    most of the rest of the changes are fixes - especially the tcp code
    should now be pretty stable (knock wood).
    
    Changes:
    
     - NFS is in. As are some stubs for the soud drivers, although it's only
       stubs right now.
     - various fixes around the place: the serial problems are hopefully
       gone, and there are patches to both TCP/IP and SCSI to make them more
       stable.
     - Minor fixes: the keyboard buglet introduced in 0.98pl6 should be
       gone, and some other bugs are also corrected.  The optimized
       read-ahead code in the filesystems (and the raw device read code) was
       too complicated and seemed to have problems with bad blocks, so I
       rewrote it, and it should hopefully work correctly now (this may have
       been the reason "mkfs -c" didn't work in all cases).  Thanks for some
       good bug-reports I've gotten: I've tried to correct all the problems
       I got reports on.
     - The kernel configuration has been re-thought: I decided to take
       advantage of the possibilities offered by GNU make etc.  This means
       that you no longer can compile the kernel using any other make, but
       there probably aren't many (if any) people doing that anyway.  This
       way I got rid of the extremely ugly SCSI setup, so it was probably
       worth it.
    
    To configure the kernel for your setup, do a
    
            make config
    
    and answer the yes/no questions. After that, do a
    
            make dep
    
    to make the dependencies match your setup.  After that you should still
    go edit the top-level Makefile for some of the configuration information
    as before, but the remaining config things are pretty simple.  Then you
    can make the kernel with a simple "make Image".
    
    The new configuration utility (essentially a stupid shell script coupled
    with some smarts in the Makefiles) tries to minimize compilations: if
    you disable the SCSI code the scsi drivers won't even be compiled, much
    less linked in.  This should be a win on slower machines.
    
    NOTE!!! Use LILO-0.7 to load the 0.98pl5 and newer kernels: any older
    version of lilo is liable to result in weird problems.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.98.6 (December 2, 1992)
    
    Kai Makisara does the SCSI tape driver.  He's one of the few original
    maintainers still around as such..
    
    isofs introduced by Eric Youngdale, based on the minixfs code.  Eric was
    a physicist, and you can tell he was new to C - he has been
    Pascal-damaged, and has extra semi-colons at the end of block
    statements.  But soon he ended up being one of the core maintainers
    anyway, and took over SCSI maintenance.
    
    More aggressive filesystem read-ahead introduced.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Anyway, 0.98pl6 is hopefully the last release before 0.99: there are a
    few known problems left in this release.  Most notable is the serial
    code: it works for most people, but others still have problems with it.
    I hope this will get fixed within a week (tytso is working on it).  It
    also seems as if the PS/2 mouse code has some problems.
    
    pl6 contains these fixes:
    
     - all the tcp/ip patches I've received (and I fixed one bug that
       gcc-2.3 seems to have found).
     - math-emu patch for the problem that resulted in FPU errors with some
       operations.
     - I fixed gcc-2.3 warnings as well as most of the old warnings.  You
       shouldn't get more than one or two warnings when recompiling the
       whole kernel.
     - /proc filesystem extensions.  Based on ideas (and some code) by
       Darren Senn, but mostly written by yours truly.  More about that
       later.
     - some tty_io fixes (there was a bug in the /dev/console handling when
       you changed VC's while using the general console device).
     - re-organization of the keyboard-driver internal data-structures.  The
       changes are mostly preliminary: they change the keyboard flags to be
       more easily adaptive to a reprogrammable keyboard driver.  No actual
       new features yet.
     - new SCSI drivers: reportedly much faster than the old ones (but not
       all drivers take advantage of it yet..)
     - various other fixes: pty's etc have minor changes.
    
    I hope to make 0.99 in a week or so, and 1.0 after that has been tested
    some.  I hope people will test out pl6 - 0.99 won't be much different,
    and if you don't test pl6, any bugs relating to your particular hardware
    may not be found in time for 0.99...

    [PATCH] Linux-0.98.5 (November 15, 1992)
    
    net-1: free_skb -> kfree_skb. More changelogs.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    0.98.5 mainly fixes the swap-partition bug that was present in pl4 (and
    for which I did an earlier unofficial emergency patch).  The bug
    resulted in incorrect swapping with a partition under some circumstances
    (notably tty events: keypresses could make xterm dump code when swapping
    was enabled etc).
    
    pl5 also has some other changes - nothing major.  Setting and querying
    termios information from a pty master will now set/query the slave info:
    this seems to be what some programs (telnet) expect.  I haven't seen any
    changes to any of the programs I use, but I'd like to hear if this
    results in problems or if it actually does help.
    
    NOTE! READ THIS AND PONDER:
    
    pl5 now checks against writing to the text segment.  Older binaries
    which used the original estdio library (used with the earliest gcc
    versions) are liable to break: not that there should be many of these
    binaries around.  So if you get "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" on
    binaries you know used to work, this is the likely cause.
    
    One problem spot that I've seen even with new binaries is due to a
    library bug in 'sigaction()'.  If the second argument is NULL (ie the
    pointer to the new sigaction structure), sigaction() will incorrectly
    dereference it resulting in a core-dump.  The only program so far that
    I've seen doing this is 'dd', but there may be others.
    
    On my system I have found a whopping total of two binaries which didn't
    like the text segment protection, so it shouldn't really be a major
    problem for anybody.  Famous last words.
    
                    Linus
    
    PS. The strace code in pl4 was incorrectly credited in the announcement.
    The code was written by Branko Lankester, not Ross Biro (who did the
    tcp/ip changes).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.98.4 (November 9, 1992)
    
    Rename "malloc()/free()" as "kmalloc()/kfree()" to make people more
    aware of some of the limitations.
    
    Math emulator updates to handle the case that Linux (unlike the original
    djgpp target) can get preempted by user space accesses.
    
    Make "ll_rw_blk()" take an array of blocks to read/write.
    
    VFS "notify_change()" callback, to allow the low-level filesystem to
    decide what it wants to do about metadata changes.
    
    Deprecate old "stat()" call by printing out a warning on use.
    
    NR_OPEN is now 256 files per process, and the old "unsigned long" bitops
    needed to go away. This causes lots of syntactic changes in select().
    
    System call tracing implemented for ptrace().
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
     - the inode caching bug (resulting in bad filesystem info when
       mounting/umounting devices) should be gone for good.
    
     - an elusive race-condition in the fs is fixed: this may have been the
       reason some people got fsck errors once in a while.  The
       race-condition was pretty hard to find, and depends on a lot of
       things (buffer cache size, speed of the disk and computer speed).
    
     - fpu emulator patches (mainly for the re-entrancy problem) by me and
       W. Metzenthen.
    
     - various wait-queue changes - the kernel uses the waiting mechanism
       more efficiently now.
    
     - the NFS client support code is there: the actual nfs code is still in
       alpha (although reported to be pretty stable) and has to be gotten
       separately.
    
     - NR_OPEN was changed from 32 to 256 (which is what SunOS seems to use,
       so I hope it won't need any further changes).  This has lead to some
       incompatibilities (GNU emacs and the term program seem to need
       recompilation to work correctly), as the 'select()' system call has a
       slightly changed interface due to the new fd_set definition.
    
     - the process kernel stack is now on a separate page (needed due to the
       fact that the task_struct has now grown to almost 3kB due to the
       NR_OPEN changes).  This also means 'ps' needs patches..  My patches
       to ps-0.98 are available as 'ps-diff.Z' in the same directory as the
       kernel sources and diffs.
    
     - various other changes: system call tracing by Ross Biro. Changed
       ll_rw_block interface (performance reasons: it will eventually be
       changed to accept several requests at once).  Malloc() was changed
       and renamed to kmalloc() due to the new interface.  Some tcp/ip
       patches (inode counting correction and some other changes).
    
    0.98.4 should hopefully be pretty stable: the main problem areas are
    probably still tcp/ip and some of the tty code.  I'd appreciate
    comments, bug-reports etc.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.98.3 (October 27, 1992)
    
    More networking updates.. Ross Biro is still struggling with net-1.
    
    Michael Johnson (now RH kernel release manager) works on line printer
    driver.
    
    Locking function cleanups (for inodes, superblocks, buffer heads).  We
    also now pass in the superblock pointer instead of the device number to
    the filesystem routines.  That cleans up use and locking of
    "get_super()" a lot.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Ok, I already sent out an announcement last night, but due to the time
    (6AM over here) I wasn't really in a mood to write a real annoucement.
    Here it is.
    
    linux-0.98.3 is available by anonymous ftp at least on nic.funet.fi:
    pub/OS/Linux/testing/Linus, both as context diffs against 0.98.2 and the
    pre-version of 0.98.3 and as complete source. The complete source
    package was done by directly applying the diffs - this means that the
    Makefile dependancies are probably not 100% up-to-date as I remove those
    from the diffs. It shouldn't be any problem, and you can always do a
    "make dep ; make clean" before actually compiling the kernel.
    
    0.98 pl3 fixes several bugs, and should remove all known NULL-pointer
    problems that made 0.98.2 unusable for most people. In addition to the
    NULL pointer fixes, the following things have changed:
    
    - removed most of the cli-sti pairs in the filesystem code by rewriting
      the locking routines to use a different algorithm, possible due to
      the rewritten wait-queue code that I did back in 0.96c or so.
      Interrupt latency should be better on slow machines, but I don't know
      if it's noticeable.
    - Minor 387-emulation fixes by Bill Metzenthen - only noticeable under
      special conditions.
    - Corrected various error-returns in the fs (thanks to Bruce Evans for
      running some error diagnostics). Error messages when opening (and
      renaming etc) files that had a non-directory in the path were wrong,
      and should be ok now (ie giving ENOTDIR instead of EACCESS or ENOENT).
      Some other problems reported by Bruce fixed.
    - Changed the interface for some fs-related functions due to cleaning
      up super-block handling. Most noticeably, iget() and related
      functions no longer specify the inode with a device and inode number,
      but instead with a super-block pointer and inode number. This is
      more logical, and should make unnamed devices (ie internal
      filesystems like nfs and /proc) cleaner. Also note that the calling
      sequence for sb->s_op->put_inode() also has changed since 0.98. This
      is of interest only if you are writing filesystem drivers..
    - ASK_SVGA was broken in 0.98.2 - it should be ok now.
    
    Also, various minor fixes as usual. No new features, but I hope 0.98.3
    will be a lot less bug-prone due to the changes since 0.98.1. Some
    minor tcp/ip corrections (but most of them were in the pre-release), and
    I removed a race-condition in the tty-handling code.
    
    Note that people who use math without a co-processor should certainly
    upgrade to 0.98.3: the new emulator is much better than my original one
    both in speed and accuracy/exception handling. x11perf is very much
    bearable now even without a 387, and things like ray-tracing etc
    shouldn't be a problem any more. It's slower than hardware fp, of
    course, but at least it works.
    
    The new emulator also means there is no reason for a separate soft-float
    library, so I'd assume that will be gone in the next gcc release for
    linux.
    
    As usual, a new kernel version probably means you'll have to recompile
    'ps' and friends. But at least the same 'ps' sources that worked for
    0.97.6 should still work.

Date:   Fri Nov 23 15:09:06 2007 -0500

    [PATCH] Linux-0.98.2 (October 18, 1992)
    
    Start virtualizing real mmap() functionlity in the kernel.  The first
    signs of me thinking about this already showed up as some unused header
    files earlier, this fleshes things out some more.  No actual filesystem
    code yet..
    
    This also removes my old simple math emulator, and introduces the new
    and much improved one from Bill Metzenthen.
    
    Bill originally wrote it for the djgpp suite (DJ Delories gcc port to
    DOS extenders).  It was much more accurate and well designed than my
    hackish one, and I was happy to throw my old code away.  The new math
    emulator also did things that I had never bothered with, notably the
    more complex i387 functions (exponentials and trig).
    
    I also fixed the static maximum memory limit: we now generate the kernel
    page tables dynamically rather than having a 16M or 32M static limit.
    
    SCSI updates: removable media support (which also implies re-reading the
    partition table etc)
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    patch-2 is >150kB compressed, as it contains several big changes. Most
    notable are:
    
     - the new FPU-emulator by Bill Metzenthen.  It's bigger than the old
       one, but thanks to it, linux fpu emulation is no longer a quick hack,
       but a real emulator: it does all the 387(486) math instructions, and
       does them much faster than the old emulator + the soft library.
    
       The new math-emulator means that a separate soft-float library is no
       longer needed.  It also makes even a non-coprocessor system pretty
       useful for limited math-calcs - the complex functions are much faster
       when they no longer have to be calculated using simple functions, and
       even the simpler instructions that my old emulator handled are faster
       using the new one.
    
       The size of the new emulator may mean that people who have little
       RAM, but do have a coprocessor should probably recompile the kernel
       with the emulator disabled.
    
     - various minor mm fixes by me: trapping kernel NULL dereferences,
       cleaning up the page table initializations and the 16MB patches, and
       various other bugfixes.  get_free_page(GFP_ATOMIC) should preserve
       the interrupt flag, so malloc() should be safe now - hopefully no
       more of the tcp/ip memory management problems.
    
       The NULL pointer trapping may result in errors like:
            Unable to handle kernel paging request at address C0000???
            Oops: 0000
            ..... debugging info .....
    
       There were several NULL pointer dereferences in the serial and tty
       drivers, which should now be fixed.  I've also fixed any other errors
       I've seen, but if there are problems in the scsi drivers or similar
       things I cannot test, I'd like to hear about them.
    
     - scsi driver changes by Eric Youngdale.  Preliminary support for
       removable media, and some bug-fixes.  Due to white-space problems
       with eric's patches, the scsi patches are a bit bigger than
       necessary, but they should be ok even though I had to put them in
       partly by hand (and being unable to test them...)
    
     - The new tcp/ip patches that were sent to the NET channel not long
       ago.  Yes, they are alpha, but so is the whole tcp/ip directory, so I
       put them in even thought they haven't been extensively tested (and
       they did have a serious problem in the ioctl code, which I fixed).
    
     - psaux mouse patches by Dean Troyer, as well as the mouse.wait = NULL
       patch.
    
    Before (or after) patching, you should remove the old math-emulator (ie
    "rm -rf /usr/src/linux/kernel/math") as it is no longer needed.  You
    should also do a "make dep" to update dependencies: as usual, I edited
    out the dependancy-changes.  Do a "make clean", edit the main (and net)
    Makefiles to suit your system, and compile.
    
    And finally: I will no longer be making the bootdisks available -
    they'll be made by hlu/jwinstead and will probably be boot+root-disks
    using lilo, as done on the hlu disks.  That may mean that a bootimage
    won't be available at once, but most people who want to use the
    absolutely newest images probably compile them themselves anyway, so
    that shouldn't be a problem.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.98.1 (October 5, 1992)
    
    Add ATI XL busmouse driver by Bob Harris, split off MS busmouse driver into
    a driver of its own (rather than a subdriver of the Logitech mouse driver)
    
    FAT uid/gid/umask mount options.
    
    SCSI driver updates.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Patch1 to 0.98 mainly corrects some driver problems: it contains the
    added "inb_p(HD_STATUS)" for hd.c, as well as a changed mouse driver
    setup (hope it works - I couldn't test it..).  There are also some SCSI
    driver patches: the seagate driver uses irqaction() to get irq's, and
    the aha1542 driver has the speedup patches.
    
    The bootimage should be compiled without the auto-SVGA mode, so people
    who had problems with linux automatically using a SVGA mode should be ok
    in this release.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.98 (September 29, 1992)
    
    Real networking (TCP) merged! This is the now-called "net-1" code by
    Ross Biro.  Boy, was it ugly, but it made for a big jump from not having
    any at all.
    
    (And add support for up the 32MB of memory ;)
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Sorry for being late - I can't even show any great new features in 0.98,
    but at least it's out now, and available at the normal place (ie at
    nic.funet.fi, pub/OS/Linux/testing/Linus).  So far there is only a
    full-source version available, although I'll probably make it available
    as a patch too tomorrow or so (but the patch won't contain the tcp/ip
    stuff).
    
    0.98 is essentially the same as 0.97.pl6 - the changes are mostly:
     - tcp/ip (0.8.1) is in.  It's not compiled into the standard bootimage,
       and you'd better be on the tcpip mailing-list to use it, but it's
       there. I've been unable to test it further than just watch it
       compile...
     - extfs patch to correct the problem with big directories with holes.
     - mouse patches (ie improved detection-routines)
     - minor scsi patches (ultrastor driver change)
     - swiss keyboard
     - some serial driver patches
     - the 32mb patches are in, so if you aren't using a DMA-SCSI driver,
       and have more than 16MB physical memory, you can get it recognized.
     - edited hd.c
     - corrected core-dumping routines
    
    I didn't get my mm patches working yet, so they'll have to wait.  The
    above are almost 100% by others - I have edited some of the patches, but
    there is nothing major new by me.  Most of it is minor bug-fixes, and
    the only thing that might be a bit of a problem are the hd.c changes:
    but I hope they'll solve more problems than they cause.  Knock wood.
    
    At nic.funet.fi you can currently find (a) the full sources (b) a
    bootimage (US keyboard, floppy root, no tcp/ip) and (c) the protocols.h
    file needed for compiling the tcp/ip directory (which should go into
    /usr/include/netinet/).  I hope people try it out, and that there are no
    new problems with this release.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.97.6 (September 20, 1992)
    
    Ted Ts'o did extensive serial driver changes, and fixed up some of the
    tty layer to match.  Tty's now allocated dynamically.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    This patch does not contain any major bug-fixes: it corrects named pipes
    that broke with pl5, and has some minor changes in the IO-instructions
    and the hd-driver, but those shouldn't matter for most of you.
    
    It does contain all the scsi-patches that I've gotten so far, so if the
    bootup sequence died on you in the scsi code, pl6 should correct this.
    
    The major part of the patch is tytso's serial line changes, making the
    tty structures dynamic.  No more NR_PTY's - the number of pty's is now
    bounded only by the minor number setup (max 64 pty's) or the amount of
    memory available (opening a pty requires a page of memory for tty
    queues).  Similarly for serial lines.
    
    The above just means that while pl6 can be useful, the changes to pl5
    aren't big enough to worry about.  Most people don't use named pipes, it
    seems, and the other changes are either cosmetic or hardware-dependent.
    I still hope people upgrade, if only so that I can get new bug-reports.
    
    I had hoped to release 0.98 this weekend, but studies and the scsi/hd
    problems put an end to that.  0.98 should be out next weekend or so.
    Expect the tcp/ip subdirectory and possibly some mm changes.

    patches and several other minor changes).  Pl5 finally removes even the
    last few header-files that were incompatible with the normal headers, so
    the "-nostdinc -I$(KERNELHDRS)" stuff is gone.
    
    Patch 5 should also fix the problems with iopl() that resulted in the
    X8514-server having problems with 0.97.pl2 and above.
    
    In case people are wondering, my schedule for 1.0 looks something like
    this:
    
     - 0.98 out in about a week: this is essentially 0.97.5 + the tcp/ip
       directory, as well as any fixes that may come up.  I'll try to get
       the loadable driver interface into it too.
    
     - 0.99 out after 0.98 has been shaken down: a month or so.
    
     - 1.0 will be the same as 0.99: the only changes will be eventual
       trivial bug-fixes in case 0.99 has some problems.  This is just to
       try to get over the "X.0" bug syndrome.
    
    There are a few on-going projects: depending on circumstances these will
    be implemented sooner or later, so I won't give any promises.  These
    include: loadable drivers/fs's (alpha-patches already availabla), full
    support for different block-sizes (some work still required), and a
    extensive rewrite of the mm routines (I'll want to make a vmm interface
    similar to the vfs interface for the filesystem routines).

    [PATCH] Linux-0.97.4 (September 7, 1992)
    
    Linus "dances with patches" Torvalds strikes again: I've already made
    patchlevel 4 of 0.97.  It may not be a new record, but it's close :-)
    
    Patch 4 is a very minor patch, but it's pretty important if you want a
    stable filesystem (and let's face it: most people seem to prefer a
    filesystem that stays up a bit longer).  While patch3 corrected most of
    the race-conditions in the minix fs, I overlooked the [f]truncate system
    calls, and this new patch corrects that.
    
    [f]truncate is a very race-prone function, and as if that wasn't enough,
    there was also a pretty bad error in truncate.c that resulted in the
    indirect blocks not being correctly marked dirty when doing partial
    truncates.  The latter problem is probably the reason for most of the
    filesystem corruptions that have been reported - the race-conditions
    were a lot harder to fix, but they also happen a lot less often.
    
    Note that the [f]truncate bug isn't new: it has been in the kernel since
    [f]truncate was first implemented (0.95?).  But until now, [f]truncate()
    hasn't actually been used very much - only the latest versions of the
    binutils have used ftruncate to strip binaries etc.  So the problem
    hasn't shown up that much.
    
    So while I consider patch4 to be crucial, you /can/ actually live
    without it: I haven't seen the buffer corruption problem at all (until I
    actually tested for it after getting good bug-reports), so you can
    provably miss it for a long time.  But if you have ever had corruption
    problems, I'd suggest upgrading to pl4 as soon as possible.
    
    The corruption problems show up most clearly when using a new "strip"
    binary, although they are theoretically possible with other programs
    too.  Thanks to "obz@raster.kodak.com" and "jon@robots.ox.ac.uk" for
    good bug-reports: thanks to them I was able to pin down the error to
    truncate.c, and after that it was pretty easy to get rid of it.
    
    Also note that this patch still hasn't fixed the extended filesystem: I
    suspect the same bugs lurk around there.  I'll get it corrected by 0.98
    at the latest.
    
    The patch is included at the end of this post (it's very minor - it
    contains patches mainly against linux/fs/minix/truncate.c) , and I'll
    also update nic.funet.fi (pub/OS/Linux/testing/Linus) to have the new
    sources.  Sorry for the inconvenience,

    [PATCH] Linux-0.97.3 (September 5, 1992)
    
    Hey, we switched to the GPL several months ago, but only now do we
    include the license text itself.  Apparently everybody expected
    everybody else to just know what the GPL was..
    
    Add a README on compiling the kernel (by Lasu)
    
    Add PS/2 mouse driver, make generic "mouse" infrastructure.
    
    Add /proc filesystem, clean up minixfs block mapping.
    
    sys_wait4() and swapoff().
    
    VM gets a "secondary page free" list for things like interrupts
    that want a page _now_ and can't wait for the regular free list
    to fill up.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Patch3 is almost 100kB even compressed, as there were quite big changes
    in the mm and minix fs.  No major new features: there are two new system
    calls: swapoff(const char * swapfile) and wait4(), and linux accepts
    several swap-files, but the rest of the thing is mostly bug-fixes or
    simply rewrites.
    
    Major changes:
     - new swap-page handling: linux no longer uses just one bit to keep
       track of used swap-space, but a counter for each swap-page.  This
       allows processes to share swap-pages after a fork(), and should
       result in /major/ performance increases on machines with less memory.
       I've seen better performance even with 8MB - I wouldn't be surprised
       if 4MB machines would re-compile the kernel noticeably faster under
       pl3.  I'd be interested to hear numbers.
     - The low 1MB memory that isn't used directly by the kernel is now
       swappable memory, instead of being hardcoded for buffer cache.  The
       patches for this were originally by tytso, and I expanded on it a bit
       more.  This might also help better performance on 2-4MB machines.
       Note that this does /not/ mean that you can use 1M machines for
       linux: linux still needs some extended memory.
     - the dosfs has been upgraded to dosfs.8 - patches by almesber.
     - I edited the minix fs pretty heavily to remove a couple of race-
       conditions.  The same races still exist in the extended fs, as I
       didn't have time to edit that yet.  The minix-fs took precedence as I
       know that better, and extfs isn't "official" yet anyway.
    
    other changes:
    
     - the mouse-driver now handles both Logitech (minor = 0) and PS/2
       (minor = 1) busmice.
     - there is a proc-fs for access to user memory/files etc.
     - better support for the tcp/ip patches (but see below...)
     - corrected symlink and /dev/[k]mem behaviour
     - Lars Wirzenius' README (with minimal comments by me) and the GNU
       COPYING notice are now part of the normal kernel setup, and can be
       found in the tar-archive.
     - the floppy ioctl() to get the FD parameters no longer requires root
       priviledges.  Thus, the msdos emulator runs even for a normal user.
    
    Some comments on patchlevel 3:
    
            mm:
    
    The swap-page handling resulted in a reduction of swap-file (or
    partition) size to a maximum of 16MB per file.  It's nothing inherent to
    the code, but it eased some algorithms, so I didn't bother coding around
    it.  After all, 16MB is enough for most people, and if you want more,
    you can have up to 128 swapfiles of 16MB each.  If I get enough
    hate-mail about it, I might just try to find the energy to correct it.
    Maybe.
    
    Bigger swapfiles will still work, but linux will take advantage of only
    the low 16MB.  Also, there is no nifty logic to try to optimize the
    usage of the swap-files: pages are simply allocated from one swap-file
    until it fills up, and then the next swap-file is used.
    
    The memory management changes break ps/free once more, but not very
    much.  Also, I changed the load-average counting, so 'w' also needs
    slight editing.  On the other hand, I made '/dev/kmem' mmap()able, and
    'ps' and 'free' should be edited to take advantage of that: it should
    result in much faster operation, as well as possibly using less real
    memory.
    
            fs:
    
    The fs changes should remove at least two races - the races don't happen
    very often, but they were theoretically possible, and might be the
    reason for some fs corruption problems that have been reported.  The
    changes are related to the use of bmap() - the bmap interface doesn't
    really lend itself to some things that it was used for.  Re-writing
    internal fs-functions not to use bmap not only should have removed any
    races, but also actually resulted in cleaner code.
    
    The proc-fs code isn't too beautiful, and I'll probably leave it out
    from 0.98 unless I can make it loadable.  We'll see.  If anybody wants
    to use it, you can do something like
    
      # mount -t proc /dev/ram /proc
    
    Instead of /dev/ram you can use any block device - it's not used, and is
    only a dummy as the proc-fs doesn't actually use any external device.
    (but note that the device is still marked as mounted, so you cannot
    mount it for anything else).
    
            kernel/mm/lib:
    
    The TCP/IP patches are also essentially in 0.97.pl3 - not the full
    TCP/IP directory, only the patches to the main kernel.  NOTE!! I don't
    like the 'grab_malloc_pages()' function, so I left that out, and added a
    GFP_ATOMIC priority to get_free_page() that should be used instead.  I
    hope this will be used (Ross?), as it's a lot cleaner.
    
    Also, I hope the tcp/ip people will clean up malloc() so that it doesn't
    panic instead of returning NULL etc.  Ugly, ugly.  This is related to
    the get_free_page(GFP_ATOMIC) changes, and I'd like to have patches as
    soon as possible - tcp/ip won't be part of the standard kernel until
    that can be cleaned up.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.97.2 (August 23, 1992)
    
    We're making ready for big processes, and vm86 mode!
     - Move the kernel to virtual address 0xc0000000 instead of zero.
     - Allocate per-process page tables
    
    We can now have 3GB processes, and more than 64 of them!
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    As promised, 0.97.pl2 is out today (well, over here it's already
    tomorrow, so I guess I'm 35 minutes late.  Naughty, naughty).  Right
    now, the patch (and full source for those that don't like to patch up
    the system) is available at "nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/testing/Linus",
    but I'll try to put it on some other sites as well if I'm able and
    energetic enough.  Probably tomorrow - together with a binary for those
    that aren't willing to comple the kernel on their own.
    
    0.97.2 has mostly my mm/fs patches, along with some relatively minor
    diffs by others (including file locking by Doug Evans).  User-level
    changes are minor: but the mm has changed a lot, and the vfs routines
    have been changed to keep track of the error-messages a bit better.
    Also, the vfs-interface to "follow_link()" changed slightly: people who
    are making filesystems should look at the changes (but they are
    relatively minor, and shouldn't result in any problems - both the
    extended fs and minix fs needed just a simple change in their respective
    symlink.c files).
    
    The mm changes /might/ lower performance slightly, as the paging TLB's
    are now flushed at every task-switch due to the new system, but I doubt
    it's noticeable.  The other performance changes (dynamic buffers etc) in
    0.97(.pl1) should overshadow that particular problem.
    
    I hope this release means that these kinds of low-level rewrites aren't
    needed for a while: the last couple of releases have changed some very
    fundamental things.  Nothing seems to have suffered too badly, but I'd
    be happier if it all got tested more thoroughly.  Anyway, discounting
    the ps/free etc suite of programs, everything I have tried has worked
    flawlessly despite the big kernel changes.
    
    I'm still worried about the reports about messed-up buffers, but have
    been unable to reproduce the problem, and nobody has so far
    disillusioned me about my guess that it's a problem with the SCSI code
    (which at least gives me an excuse for not doing anything about it :-).
    Other problems include at least one report of spontaneous re-booting,
    which is totally inexplicable, so I'm blaming hardware once more until I
    can get better data on the thing.
    
    As to patches sent by others: 0.97.2 contains very little of that kind
    of code.  I've been too busy either working, or implementing my own
    changes that I have simply ignored them for the most part.  Remind me
    (or resend them relative to the new kernel) if you have a patch that is
    still needed.
    
    There is one new system call: 'vm86(struct vm86_struct * info)'.  It's
    not ready for general use yet - it works, but will probably need some
    tweaking before being practical.  But supporting a virtual 86 mode was
    so easy after the mm rewrite that I felt it was worth implementing: the
    vm86 code is less than 50 lines of C right now.

    PS.  The bright spot of the week goes to "The Oxford Beer Trolls" - all
    UK inhabitants should probably be locked into some (big) mental
    institution and TOBT should probably have a wing of their own, but
    thanks to them linux can now call itself "beerware" :-)

    [PATCH] Linux-0.97.1 (August 6, 1992)
    
    Make the page allocator use a free page list instead of a silly
    linear search.
    
    Add sys_vhangup() and stubs for send/rcv/sendto/recvfrom/shutdown.
    We're making ready for real networking..
    
    Remove nonworking extfs bitmap allocators. We'll have them in ext2.
    
    [Original announcement below]
    
    Patch 1 is essentially a performance-release, but it also contains some
    other patches: Ross Biro's tcp-ip stubs are there (but not the tcpip
    subdirectory: alpha-testers should know where to find that), as are the
    ext-fs superblock cleanups. The first header-file patch by hlu is also
    in there.
    
    The resulting patch is pretty big - it's also not as cleaned up as I'd
    like it to be.  The swapping/buffer-block handling heuristics are
    better, but could still do with some tuning.  Also, the idle task in
    this version doesn't do very much: it will be expanded to do some more
    page-table calculations.
    
    I will be unable to hack on linux for a couple of weeks (I'll still
    answer mails, read the newsgroup and fix bugs, but no heavy-duty
    hacking) due to some "circumstances beyond my control".  That probably
    means that this patch is the last one for a while (three weeks) unless
    some bad bugs show up.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.97 (August 1, 1992)
    
    Move <xxx.h> to <linux/xxxx.h>
    
    Variable-sized buffer blocks and dynamic buffer cache allocation. The VM
    knows how to shrink it automatically!
    
    Add support for "fast" interrupt handlers for serial lines.
    
    Update copyrights to say 1992 too.
    
    Remove broken VESA video card handling.
    
    Separate out partition handling code ("genhd").
    
    Make init unkillable.
    
    Norwegian keyboard map.
    
    Future Domain SCSI controller driver by Rik Faith.
    
    Changes in 0.97:
    
     - The VESA-support was removed.  I'd be happy to put it back once it
       works on all hardware.  Instead of the VESA-code, I finally put in
       the automatic SVGA setup patches.  See the top-level Makefile.
    
     - The IRQ code has solidified, and should work on all machines.  Not
       all of the SCSI drivers use it yet, so I expect patches for that..
    
     - Serial interrupts are handled slightly differently, and performance
       should be up.  I've sent out a few alpha-releases, and testing seems
       to indicate that's actually true this time.  Reactions have ranged
       from "nice" to "wonderful" :-)
    
     - The buffer-cache and memory management code has been edited quite a
       bit.  ps/free etc programs that reads kernel memory directly no
       longer work, and even a recompilation won't be enough.  They actually
       need editing before they work.
    
       The buffer-cache now grows and shrinks dynamically depending on how
       much free memory there is.  Shift+PrintScreen will give some memory
       statistics.  (Ctrl+PrSc gives task-info, ALT+PrSc gives current
       register values).
    
       The mm code changes removed some race-conditions in the VM code, and
       I also tried to make the Out-of-swapspace error less severe (better
       thrashing-detection etc).
    
     - The super-block code has been cleaned up.  Especially the extended fs
       needs to be edited a bit to take advantage of the new setup, and I
       expect Remy Card will have a patch out eventually.
    
     - include-files have been moved around some more: there are still some
       names that clash with the standard headers, but not many.
    
     - Unswappable processes implemented: by default only 'init' is
       unswappable.  This is a bit safer in low-memory conditions, as at
       least init won't die due to low memory.  I also made killing init
       impossible: if init doesn't recognize a signal, it simply won't get
       it.  Some other changes ("while (1) fork();" won't kill the machine
       for non-root users etc)
    
     - The new SCSI drivers are in.  These make the kernel noticeably
       bigger, but you can leave them out if you don't want them.
    
     - The floppy- and hd-drivers print out more debugging-info in case of
       errors: this might be irritating if you have hardware that works, but
       often gives soft-errors.  On the other hand, some old debugging-info
       was removed - notably for user-level protection errors etc.
    
     - Various minor fixes.  I haven't made cdiffs (and I haven't gotten any
       requests for them, so I probably never will), but they would be
       pretty big.
    
    Things that I didn't have time for:
    
     - I wanted to rewrite the tty drivers to be more "streams-like" (ie not
       an actual streams-implementation, but some of the ideas from
       streams).  I never got around to it: there was simply too much else
       to do.
    
     - I got a lot of patches, and some went in, others didn't.  If you
       think your patch was important, please re-send it relative to the new
       version.
    
    I'd like comments on the new system: performance / clarity of code etc.
    0.97 should correct all known bugs (at least the ones I know about), but
    I guess that's just wishful thinking.
    
    Note that the dynamic buffer-code also handles differently-sized
    buffers, but that the rest of the system (block device drivers,
    filesystem code etc) cannot yet take advantage of this - there is still
    some coding needed.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.96-pre (April 21, 1992)
    
    More VFS layer work: remove more special cases, and take advantage of
    the virtual VFS functions (close and select).  Add fchown/fchgrp and
    [f]truncate.
    
    Orest Zborowski shows up, and works on porting X11 to X.  This needs a
    lot of infrastructure support: ioperm() for user-mode IO port access,
    and SVR style virtual terminal ioctl's to make porting easier.  Perhaps
    more importantly, the mmap() system call shows up, even if it right now
    is limited only to a direct /dev/mem remapping.
    
    [Original changelog below]
    
    - truncate/ftruncate/fchmod/fchown system calls
    
            note that there aren't any library functions for these, so they
            aren't very useful yet...
    
            [f]truncate needed a change in the logic of the internal
            truncate VFS call - anybody that has any nonstandard filesystem
            probably needs to look it up.
    
    - io-bitmap syscalls giving root-processes access to selected io ports
      from user space.  There is a "ioperm()" system call that lets the
      process select which ports it wants to enable/disable (all ports
      disabled as default) as well as a (standard sysv?) ioctl interface
      that X uses.
    
            again, no library stubs, but it allows things like reading and
            setting the cmos clock without using /dev/port, as well as
            control over the VGA registers...
    
    - mmap for /dev/mem
    
            more things needed for X...
    
    - the signal-handling fixes needed for gdb
    
            These aren't yet complete: serial lines still send signals under
            interrupts that can result in problems (ie ptrace doesn't
            correctly get them), but that's pretty unlikely (and will be
            fixed in the final 0.96).  Breakpoints should work etc..
    
    - multiple shared libraries
    
            Up to 6 simultaneous shared libraries/process: the patches were
            originally by pmacdona, but they were heavily changed by me, and
            I think they work in a more natural manner now.  One user-level
            change is that the libraries are now checked for read and
            execute permissions for safety-reasons.
    
    - cleaned up special files.
    
            read/write/ioctl no longer has special-case code: it is all
            handled with tables to functions.  This will mean that the SCSI
            patches won't patch in quite cleanly into 0.96: you'll need to
            add the code that sets up the functions.
    
            Again: device drivers and vfs-filesystem hackers need to look
            into the changes, although they are pretty logical (earlier
            versions just didn't implement all the vfs-routines)
    
            Note that the vfs-code for select is still not used: select is
            hardcoded for the devices it supports right now.
    
    - ptrace() has a new interface
    
            as gdb for versions < 0.95c don't work on the new version, and
            gdb won't work very well at all on 0.95c[+], there was no reason
            not to break ptrace.  Thus 0.96 has a new calling convention for
            ptrace, and the old ptrace library function no longer works.
            I'm including the new ptrace library function at the end of this
            post.
    
    - mount() takes 4 arguments, and checks that only the super-user can
      mount/umount things.
    
            Happily this shouldn't break any old binaries.
    
    - some general cleanups

commit 6f8473c79860686bd2784e7df87fff8ae3886866
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org>

    0.96c second patch
    
    The subject pretty much says it all: I've sent out the "weekly patch"
    and I'd be very interested in comments. As with patch1, there are some
    very fundamental changes in the kernel, and they might have some
    problems. I'd want as many as possible to test out linux-0.96c.pl2, as
    that has always been the best way to test out the changes. Everything
    works on my machine, but that doesn't guarantee it will work on other
    setups...
    
    The MAJOR change in 0.96c.pl2 is the totally rewritten sleep/wakeup
    code. That, together with the IRQ code introduced in pl1 and slightly
    edited in pl2, means that two very fundamental things in the linux
    kernel have changed in the last two weeks. The code is cleaner, easier
    to add devices to, and hopefully faster, but it's still a bit risky to
    change this kind of very low-level behaviour.
    
    Select() is now implemented using the vfs jump tables, and thanks to the
    better sleep/wakup interface, select() performance should be noticeably
    better. At least xload seems to give lower load-averages, and I hope
    ka9q will work better with the new kernel. Note that things like the
    tty code doesn't yet take full advantage of the new features the
    rewritten sleep offers, but I wanted to get a good testing-release out
    before actually tweaking all the routines to use the new interface.
    
    The IRQ routines have changed slightly, and all known bugs are fixed.
    
    While I'm most interested to hear comments about the IRQ and
    select/sleep/wakup code, there are a few other changes in pl2:
    
     - Swiss keyboard support.
    
     - Screen blanking now only reacts to key-presses and kernel messages:
    normal tty output doesn't make the screen unblank.
    
     - DOS-fs version 5 is in. It wouldn't hurt to try it out. It's
    somewhat alpha still, but it seems to work. mtools should be a thing of
    the past once the dosfs is a bit more tested.
    
     - core-file magic number, and a minor bug in ptrace is fixed
    
     - a bus-mouse is supported. I'd like to hear if it still works after I
    did the select() patches "blind" (I can't test it on my machine).
    
     - iopl changing is possible (but requires root priviledges): this
    allows access to all IO ports, as well as the interrupt flag. Don't use
    it unless /absolutely/ necessary: a bug in your program will most likely
    crash the machine if you are running with IO priviledges. It's needed
    for some X VGA drivers.
    
    As a result of all the changes, the diff is pretty big. Apply and build
    it with something like:
    
            cd /usr/src
            zcat linux-0.96c.patch2.Z | patch -p0
            cd linux
            make dep
            make clean
            make Image
    
    assuming you have the 0.96c.pl1 kernel in /usr/src/linux. I've had some
    reports that my patches won't always go in cleanly: I know for a fact
    that patch1 patches cleanly (I rebuilt 0.96c.pl1 by downloading it all
    from banjo), so the error is in your end.
    
    Possible problems:
    
     - The VESA code in setup.S has some problems. I haven't even looked
    into it yet, so if it won't work for you, please either (a) use the
    unpatched setup.S from 0.96c, or (b) try to find the problem and tell
    me. (b) is preferable, of course. I'd like to have VESA support, but
    if the bug isn't found, I'll have to use the non-VESA version for 0.97.
    
     - The IRQ code in 0.96c.pl1 could overrun the stack if linux got
    un-ending interrupt requests, resulting in a re-boot. With pl2, this
    shouldn't happen: linux should print out something like "Recursive
    interrupt on IRQx. Shutting down" and simply disable the problematic
    IRQ line. If you see this message, I'd be very interested to hear about
    it (which IRQ, what devices you have, etc).
    
     - And any new or old bugs I haven't found yet.
    
    I have one report that 0.96c.pl1 has problems with the inode table, and
    panics on bootup with a "no more inodes in mem" report. Can anybody
    confirm this sighting? I haven't found the reason for it, and haven't
    seen it myself. I'm hoping it's an installation problem, but if anybody
    else sees the same behaviour, I'm SOL.

Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 23 15:09:02 2007 -0500

    linux-0.96c.patch1 contains more changes than I originally envisioned: I
    changed the IRQ routines and the serial code to be easier and cleaner
    (and hopefully more efficient) and I thought that would be it. I was
    wrong.
    
    I got several patches (and one bug-report) again, and while I haven't
    had time to check them all, some of them are in. Fixes:
    
     - Remy Cards correction to the out-of-space problem with the extended
    fs is here. Most people using the ext-fs might already have applied
    this patch, in which case you might have problems patching.
    
     - my ftruncate() fix is here. Again, if you already did the trivial
    patch by hand, you'll get errors when patching.
    
     - almesber's implementation of read-only filesystems is here (after
    editing by yours truly). The mount() system call now accepts a flags
    integer as well as a pointer to some arbitraty data in user space for
    some special mount() calls. The general flags allow (a) read-only
    mounting, (b) disabling of suid executables (c) disabling of device
    special files and (d) total disabling of executables on a per-filesystem
    basis. The filesystem specific mount() info isn't currently used by any
    fs, but can be used to specify additional information that depends on a
    special fs type (a password or similar would be possible..)
    
     - the rename() system call had a bug in that it allowed moving over a
    directory: I think the code to handle this was lost in the vfs editing,
    and although the GNU mv utility checked it, a malicious (or just
    unsuspecting) program can destroy the fs using this. Thanks for the
    bug-report: it was very easy to add once I saw the problem.
    
     - support for vesa-standard svga cards in setup.S. I'm unable to test
    this, but my svga card still works after the patch, so I left it in in
    the hope that it doesn't break for anybody else.
    
     - various minor editing by me, or minor patches sent in by others.
    
    The full cdiff is almost 50kB compressed, so this is a bigger-than-usual
    patch. Hope there are no problems. People who are using the new SCSI
    drivers might have problems with my changes to the SCSI irq-setup
    changes, so be careful (actually using the original sources might be a
    good idea, and then upgrading again). I hope to get the new SCSI
    drivers into the kernel soon (definitely in time for 0.98).
    
    I'd be interested to hear comments on serial line performance, bugs,
    features, etc. As usual, I'm hoping this release won't contain any new
    bugs while fixing all the old ones, but I guess that's likely to happen
    right after the first winter olympics in Hell.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.96c (July 4, 1992)
    
    Ext filesystem support! The VFS layer switchover was successful.
    Ext support is a more FFS-like filesystem, although still quite heavily
    influenced by my original Minix filesystem.  But it allows much bigger
    filesystems (minixfs was limited to 64MB) and many more files (minixfs
    had a 16-bit inode number).
    
    Named pipes by Paul Hargrove (using the regular pipe code for actual IO).
    
    [original announcement below]
    
    0.96c is actually what I called patch3 earlier this week, but as the new
    features were pretty big and the cdiff's are probably going to be bigger
    than the normal patches, I decided I might as well make it a totally new
    minor release and make a bootimage and complete source available.
    
    0.96c contains:
     - bugfixes (tty, console driver, pty's, sockets)
     - fifo's (names pipes - Paul Hargrove & editing by me)
     - the alpha extended filesystem (Remy Card)
     - st_blocks implemented (ie du, ls give reasonable if not exact values
       for disk-space used)
     - Makefile cleanups and warnings at compile-time removed
    
    Note that while the extended filesystem code is there, and this kernel
    successfully mounts and uses the new filesystem (with long filenames and
    >64MB partitions), it's still under testing: I haven't made the mkefs
    program available, and the extended filesystem features shouldn't be
    used for other than testing right now.
    
    Some of the changes are just cleanups: most of the warnings when
    compiling the new kernel should be gone (not counting the scsi code
    which is still the old non-cleaned-up version), and the make'ing of the
    kernel is more logical now.
    
    The bugfixes include the corrected console.c driver, the socket
    corrections (without which X sometimes locks up), some pty semantics
    corrections (although I'm still not certain it's correct) and some
    editing in the general tty driver (including fixing the bug introduced
    in 0.96b.pl2 that caused a reboot with uninitialized tty devices).
    
    While the extended filesystem support isn't "official" yet, I can
    happily report that my limited testing hasn't found any problems with
    long filenames etc.  It still needs a fsck program, but 1.0 looks like a
    real possibility soon.

    As promised, here is the second patch for 0.96b which hopefully clears
    up the problems with some mice by implementing most of the serial line
    flags like 5-8 bit characters and parity. It mainly corrects only
    serial problems, but there are a couple of other patches in it too: the
    fsqrt emulation patch is here, so if you already did it, you'll get a
    bad patch for that file (which you can ignore). This patch also changes
    all instances of signal-setting to use the "send_sig()" subroutine which
    should allow gdb to debug all signals.
    
    Apart from the serial lines, I also cleaned up the general tty-handling
    routines slightly and removed at least one race-condition in the tty
    code. I don't know if it's noticeable, though.
    
    You'll need patch1 (available from all the normal sites) in order to
    apply this one. As usual, I'd like to hear if this patch does help
    people, or if there are new problems. This patch will also be available
    on the normal ftp sites, but as it was pretty minor, I decided I might
    as well include it in the post (uuencoded and compressed).
    
    (I also corrected the all-time favourite bug: linux now reports the
    right version number once more..)

    Oh, well: it's a bug in the serial drivers that I have already fixed,
    but I haven't done the c-diffs yet. I have rewritten big parts of the
    serial line code to be more easily configured for different IRQ numbers,
    and I noticed the bug while doing that. I'll make patch1 for 0.96b
    available later today or tomorrow.
    
    patch1 will be mostly just the serial driver code: it allows changing
    the irq's (and port addresses) of serial devices on the fly (with an
    ioctl call), so people that have ser4 on irq5 etc shouldn't have to
    recompile the kernel. It also returns EBUSY if you try to open a serial
    line that shares the irq-line with another line etc.
    
    Another change in patch1 will the the handling of ctrl-alt-del: it will
    send a SIGINT to the init process if the reset-function is disabled.
    This makes it ideal for a controlled shutdown, but it does need a
    /bin/init that knows about this.
    
                Linus
    
    PS. It seems both the DOS-fs and the extended fs will be out for
    alpha-testing next week, so I assume 0.97 will have them both if things
    work out ok.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.96b (June 21, 1992)
    
    First cut at core-dumping.  Also, do more dynamic boottime memory
    allocation, rather than allocating data structures statically.
    
    Allocate task structures at run-time rather than having a big array of
    them.
    
    First "obsolete" system call.  The old "stat()" system call was too
    limited, due to "struct stat" having various 16-bit fields etc (notably
    inode numbers).  We make a new stat() function, and keep the old one
    around as "old_stat()" for binary compatibility.
    
    We also need a bigger "utsname" to hold real node names.
    
    Whoo! NR_OPEN is now 32 rather than 20.
    
    itimer() support driven by X11 adoption (Darren Senn).
    
    gcc starts using fsqrt, so that gets added to the FP emulation.  We're
    still basing that on my trivial code.
    
    [Original changelog below]
    
    0.96b is not a new major release: it's pretty close to 0.96a with all my
    patches (1-4).  However, as there has been 4 patches already, I decided
    it would be time for a full kernel release along with a bootimage, so
    that people who don't feel confident with patching can use the new
    features.
    
    If you already have 0.96a patchlevel 4, 0.96b will offer you these new
    features:
    
     - the math-emulation now handles fsqrt, as gcc-2.2.2 generates that
       inline.  I haven't tested the kernel code at all: I tested the
       algorithm in user space, but I'm lazy, so I never turned off my 387
       to do real testing.  I hope it works.
     - better vt100 terminal emulation thanks to Mika Liljeberg.
     - I removed a possible race-condition in the buffer-cache code.
     - minor fixes
    
    The vt100 emulation should now be complete enough for almost everything
    (including vt100 test suites): as a result the setterm utility had to be
    changed (as the old setterm codes aren't compatible with the full vt100
    codes).  setterm-0.96b.tar.Z contains the new setterm.
    
    The soon-to-be-released gcc-2.2.2 will need the 0.96b kernel: (a) due to
    the fsqrt emulation and (b) it uses the new stat() system call.  So
    upgrading is a good idea.  (If you have a co-processor, (a) isn't used,
    but (b) still stands)
    
    If you have an unpatched 0.96a, the differences to 0.96b are roughly
    (not counting the above-mentioned new things):
    
     - corrected the disk-buffer-list bug with read/write-errors
     - fixed read-ahead warning messages at end of disk
     - better support for text-mode restoration after running MGR and X
     - full core-dumping, attach/detach etc debugging features
     - 16550A support
     - less low 1MB memory used for kernel structures
     - various minor fixes
    
    Note that the fact that new versions (pl4 and above) use more memory in
    the 1M+ area means that linux will report less free memory (it's used
    for buffer-cache instead).  This could concievably be a problem on 2MB
    machines.  The standard kernel comes with only 4 pty's though, and if
    you use the standard 80x25 text modes instead of svga modes, the VC
    buffers will be smaller.  Please contact me if there are problems even
    with this minimal setup.
    
    0.96b does /not/ contain: the new scsi drivers, new filesystems or some
    other patches I have gotten (ibm character set mode, loop-devices etc).
    If you have sent me any other patch, you might want to remind me about
    it.

    32-bit inodes: patch4
    
    Ok, patch4 implements 32-bit inode numbers (and thus the new
    stat/lstat/fstat system calls), as well as correcting the bad
    rs-performance on some machines that showed up in patch3. It's
    currently only on banjo, but I'll copy it around eventually.
    
    Again, you don't miss much if you don't use this patch: it's mainly for
    (a) the serial problems and (b) for hlu etc that want to test out the
    32-bit interface. It does some other magical tricks as well (uses less
    memory in the low 1M region by moving the screen and tty buffer to high
    memory), if anybody is interested.

    patch3....
    
    Ok, I already announced it on the kernel mailing-list, but I might as
    well go all the way. I put out patch3 to 0.96a yesterday, and it's
    available on banjo in pub/Linux/Linus, and I'll upload it to the other
    normal ftp-sites tonight.
    
    NOTE! Patch3 is (like patch2) more of a kernel-hacker patch: it's just
    in case you want to keep up with my kernel. It has some problems with
    some serial lines, and if you experience them, I'd like to know what
    type of chip you are running (and what linux reports on bootup). If you
    don't think patching the kernel is fun, you might as well forget this
    and wait for a real release (next month?).
    
    Patch 3 contains:
    
    - support for attaching and detaching processes under gdb (but you need
      a gdb that knows about this).
    - 16550A support
    - full core-dumping (again, you need a gdb that supports it)
    - sockets have no problems with non-root binding etc
    - /dev/zero implemented (mknod /dev/zero c 1 5)
    
    None of the patches are very big (the whole patch is 17kB compressed,
    most of it attach/detach code), but they are all pretty useful.
    
    The 16550A support means that with the appropriate chip you now should
    be able to use the serial ports at much higher speeds, but as mentioned,
    it seems to break on some machines.
    
    The detaching isn't perfect yet (I noticed only after making the diffs
    that I had forgotten to do some cleanups), but it's not generally a
    problem (the code just forgets to give the process back to it's rightful
    father).
    
    The patch is relative to the pl2 kernel, so you have to use the earlier
    patches first. This time, I've added the lib/itimer.c code.
    
    16550A support was written by tdavis, the correct format of the
    core-dumps was written by eric (who also wrote the attach/detach code I
    used as an example when implementing it), /dev/zero was written by
    almesber. Nice to see good patches: I just did the socket-thing and
    rewrote the attaching to suit me.

    Second patch to 0.96a
    
    I have just sent off the second patch to 0.96a: it should be on the
    normal ftp-sites (nic, tsx-11 and banjo), although the only site which I
    can make it directly readable on is banjo, so on the other sites it will
    take the site-managers to make the patch available.
    
    Patch 2 implements:
    
    - itimers (by Darren Senn), which are now also used to implement the
      alarm() system call.
    
    - ultrastor scsi driver patches (by gentzel)
    
    - [f]statfs() system call is implemented (so df can be made fs-
      independent). Also some other minor fs-changes for the upcoming new
      filesystem. Patches by Remy Card.
    
    - preliminary core-file dumping code (linux creates a core-file, but
      it's not in the correct format yet [*]).
    
    - minor changes/bugfixes.
    
    While patching in patch1 is a good idea for anybody, patch 2 isn't
    really vital. I've made it available just so kernel hackers can keep up
    with the kernel I have right now if they wish. Patch 2 is relative to
    patch 1: you have to patch that in first.
    
    [*] The current core-file is very simple, and the kernel code is there
    just so that some enterprising character can expand it. A core-file
    looks like this right now:
    
    offset data
    0x0000 "core-dump: regs=\n"
    0x0040 struct pt_regs (see <sys/ptrace.c>)
    0x0400 "floating-point regs:\n"
    0x0440 struct i387 (see <linux/sched.h>)
    0x0800 the first 1kB of user-space
    
    Not very practical, but it /might/ help if the X-server dies of a
    segmentation fault or similar (you can use pt_regs.eip to see where it
    happened). The kernel code is very easy to change to accomodate for the
    real core-file format, I just didn't know what it should be.

    Here is the patch to 0.96a that corrects the harddisk error bug, dup2()
    and X11 text-mode restoration.  Thanks to Rick Sladkey for finding the
    dup2() bug.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.96a (May 22, 1992 ??)
    
    More VFS cleanups.  Minixfs code reorganized to be more logical, and
    split up into a few new files.
    
    SCSI support!!
    
     - Drew Eckhardt does the SCSI stuff, and does the ST01/ST02 lowlevel
       driver.
    
     - Ultrastor driver by David Gentzel.
    
     - Tommy Thorn shows up again.  He did the Danish keyboard tables, now
       he does the AHA 1542 driver.  Ten years later we ended up being
       co-workers at Transmeta ;)
    
    First networking code appears: X11 port needs UNIX domain sockets, and
    thus the "socketcall()" system call.  It's not really meant for real
    networking, although the code will eventually evolve to support that.
    Which explains some of the bad early decisions..  ;)
    
    Werner Almerberger starts taking over floppy driver maintenance.  Thank
    Gods!
    
    Johan Myreen translates my assembly-level keyboard driver into C code,
    and adds support for diacriticals.
    
    OMAGIC a.out format support
    
    Syslog support for the kernel appears.  If I remember correctly, this
    was Peter MacDonald, but no mention of that in the sources.

    [PATCH] Linux-0.95c+ (April 9, 1992 ??)
    
    Bruce Evans shows up here quickly.
    
    Bruce was the author of the Minix/386 patches, and had been one of my
    sounding boards for my early development, so it was very gratifying to
    see him get interested in Linux.  As it turned out, what he was _really_
    interested in was the serial driver, and the Linux serial driver was
    already in reasonably good shape.
    
    As a result, Bruce went off to work on 386BSD instead (where the serial
    driver was truly crappy), but here he worked on some boot loader cleanups.
    
    Bruce was my hero.
    
    Anyway...  More VFS work here: readdir, bmap and ioctl's are now virtual
    operations, and the superblock code is properly virtualized.
    
    Other changes:
    
     - James Wiegand writes initial parallell port printer driver
    
     - major/minor fault tracking
    
     - I rewrote big chunks of ptrace.c

    [PATCH] Linux-0.95a (March 17, 1992)
    
    Oops.  I had forgotten to change the kernel version number in 0.95 (so
    it showed as 0.12).
    
     - 80x50 console on standard VGA
     - do "memcpy_fromfs()" and "memcpy_tofs()" rather than byte-at-a-time
       to improve performance (inspired by some earlier patches by Keith White)
     - allow select() on many more file descriptors
     - support up to 4 serial ports (and increase buffering size)
     - Branko Lankester helped make extended partitions work and implemented
       DM partition table support
    
    The big deal in the release notes is actually that the root diskette
    maintainership had been moved over to Jim Winstead Jr.

commit e6c7a63f3cc9898b82d65ac3bda90d543a471c17 (Mar 8 1992)
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 23 15:09:00 2007 -0500

    [PATCH] Linux-0.95 (March 8, 1992)
    
    This was the first kernel that got released under the GPL (0.12 had a
    time-lapse to make sure the people involved accepted the license change:
    nobody ever complained).
    
    Because 0.12 had been so successful, this was supposed to be closer to
    1.0.  Yeah, right.  1.0 was eventually released almost exactly two years
    later..
    
    The big change here is the first signs of a real VFS layer: while the
    only available filesystem is still the Minix-compatible one, the code is
    factored out, and the Minix-specific stuff is put in its own directory.
    You can clearly see how the thing is moving towards having multiple
    different filesystems.
    
    The VFS changes also cause cleanups in various drivers, since we end
    up having more clear inode operation structure pointer handling.
    
    Superblock handling is still minix-specific..
    
    NOTE! We also have /bin/init finally.  It still falls through to the old
    "run shells forever" case if no init can be found, but it's starting to
    look a whole more like real UNIX user-land now..
    
    New developers: Ross Biro shows up, and does ptrace.  He will later end
    up doing the first-generation networking code.
    
    Other changes:
    
     - UK and Danish keyboard maps (and the keyboard driver supported
       "Application mode" keys from vt100+)
     - Make sure interrupts clear the 'D'irection flag
     - Floppy driver gets track buffer, which speeds it up immensely.  This
       was done based on patches by Lawrence Foard (entropy@wintermute.wpi.edu)
     - Lots of buffer cache cleanups.
     - support nonblocking pipe file descriptors
     - recursive symlink support
     - sys_swapon() means that we don't have to select the swap device
       at build (or boot) time ("Written 01/25/92 by Simmule Turner, heavily
       changed by Linus")
     - start some generic timer work (ugh, but these first timers were
       _horrible_ hardcoded things)
     - ptrace for debugging
     - console size query support with TIOC[G|S]WINSZ
     - /dev/kmem ("by Damiano")
     - rebooting (with ctrl-alt-del or sys_reboot()).
    
    From the release notes:
    
                  New features of 0.95, in order of appearance
                          (ie in the order you see them)
    
          Init/login
    
    Yeah, thanks to poe (Peter Orbaeck (sp?)), linux now boots up like a
    real unix with a login-prompt.  Login as root (no passwd), and change
    your /etc/passwd to your hearts delight (and add other logins in
    /etc/inittab etc).
    
          Bash is even bigger
    
    It's really a bummer to boot up from floppies: bash takes a long time to
    load.  Bash is also now so big that I couldn't fit compress and tar onto
    the root-floppy: You'll probably want the old rootimage-0.12 just in
    order to get tar+compress onto your harddisk.  If anybody has pointers
    to a simple shell that is freely distributable, it might be a good idea
    to use that for the root-diskette.
    
    Especially with a small buffer-cache, things aren't fun. Don't worry:
    linux runs much better on a harddisk.
    
          Virtual consoles on any (?) hardware.
    
    You can select one of several consoles by pressing the left alt-key and
    a function key at the same time. Linux should report the number of
    virtual consoles available upon bootup. /dev/tty0 is now "the current"
    screen, /dev/tty1 is the main console, and /dev/tty2-8 can exist
    depending on your text-mode or card.
    
    The virtual consoles also have some new screen-handling commands: they
    confirm even better to vt200 control codes than 0.11. Special graphic
    characters etc: you can well use them as terminals to VMS (although
    that's a shameful waste of resources), and the PF1-4 keys work somewhat
    in the application-key mode.
    
          Symbolic links.
    
    0.95 now allows symlinks to point to other symlinks etc (the maximum
    depth is a rather arbitrary 5 links). 0.12 didn't like more than one
    level of indirection.
    
          Virtual memory.
    
    VM under 0.95 should be better than under 0.12: no more lockups (as far
    as I have seen), and you can now swap to the filesystem as well as to a
    special partition. There are two programs to handle this: mkswap to set
    up a swap-file/partition and swapon to start up swapping.
    
    mkswap needs either a partition or a file that already exists to make a
    swap-area. To make a swap-file, do this:
    
          # dd bs=1024 count=NN if=/dev/hda of=swapfile
          # mkswap swapfile NN
    
    The first command just makes a file that is NN blocks long (initializing
    it from /dev/hda, but that could be anything). The second command then
    writes the necessary setup-info into the file. To start swapping, write
    
          # swapon swapfile
    
    NOTE! 'dd' isn't on the rootdisk: you have to install some things onto
    the harddisk before you can get up and running.
    
    NOTE2! When linux runs totally out of virtual memory, things slow down
    dramatically. It tries to keep on running as long as it can, but at
    least it shouldn't lock up any more. ^C should work, although you might
    have to wait a while for it..
    
          Faster floppies
    
    Ok, you don't notice this much when booting up from a floppy: bash has
    grown, so it takes longer to load, and the optimizations work mostly
    with sequential accesses.  When you start un-taring floppies to get the
    programs onto your harddisk, you'll notice that it's much faster now.
    That should be about the only use for floppies under a unix: nobody in
    their right mind uses floppies as filesystems.
    
          Better FS-independence
    
    Hopefully you'll never even notice this, but the filesystem has been
    partly rewritten to make it less minix-fs-specific. I haven't
    implemented all the VFS-patches I got, so it's still not ready, but it's
    getting there, slowly.
    
          And that's it, I think.
    
    Happy hacking.

commit 2ab763b2e26be65551e717bd547497ffb9ba7267 (Jan 15 1992)
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 23 15:08:59 2007 -0500

    Linux-0.12 (January 15, 1992)
    
    This was created from a re-packaged 0.12 tree
    
    Major milestone! Over the christmas break, I implemented paging to disk,
    meaning that you could actually use gcc on a 2MB system.  Some poor sod
    (Robert Blum) wanted to use Linux on such a system, and couldn't get the
    kernel to compile with anything less "bloated" than gcc.
    
    [ Irony alert: this was back when gcc worked fine on a system with just
      4MB.  Gone are those days. _Loong_ gone. ]
    
    The task size was still limited to 63 tasks of at most 64MB each, but
    other than that we were actually getting usable.
    
    Together with other improvements and fixes, 0.12 was actually a very
    nice kernel.  It was by now clearly more usable than Minix, which caused
    us to think that a 1.0 release was imminent.  The next kernel version
    was to be named 0.95, which turned out to be less than a stellar idea.
    
    This was also the point where we changed the copyright license.  See the
    attached original release notes.
    
    Other changes:
    
     - Ted Ts'o continued on his rampage, and implemented BSD process
       control (ie ^Z) etc.  This also introduced the process tree code,
       with pointers between parents and children, rather than iterating
       over the whole list of processes.
    
     - Ted also did SVR4-style "saved uid/gid" handling.
    
     - use the C preprocessor for assembly files, cleaning up a lot of
       duplicate definitions etc.
    
     - better boot loader diagnostics
    
     - boot sequence now can change the size of the text display.  Who the
       hell is d88-man?
    
     - fix nasty race condition between "truncate" and file IO.
    
     - add support for shared libraries with the "uselib()" system call.
       This (together with the fact that we could share clean executable
       pages) cut down on memory usage a lot.
    
     - supplemental group support.  Hey, what can I say? Unix users expected
       them.
    
     - symbolic link handling.  This was the first real extension to the
       standard Minix disk layout, and was made possible by the fact that I
       had written my own "mkfs" and "fsck".  Before that, we were still on
       crutches, in that a Linux system depended on a Minix installation for
       these fundamental system tools.
    
     - mkdir()/rmdir() isn't just for root, you know..  (Yes, seriously.
       Old-style UNIX used to limit them to root-only, since they were just
       special sequences of mknod's)
    
     - Virtual terminals by Peter MacDonald (who was to do the SLS
       distribution).
    
       Before having X, this was a _big_ deal.  The fact that Linux had
       virtual terminals with a good vt100 emulation actually made Linux
       stand out even among some of the big commercial unixes.  The Linux
       console was just _so_ much more pleasant to use that it isn't even
       funny.
    
     - first implementation of "select()", virtual terminals, and pty's.
    
       These too were originally done by Peter MacDonald, based on some
       patches that had been floating around for Minix for a long time (but
       were never accepted into Minix).
    
       They didn't get accepted into Linux either, but the patches _did_ end
       up inspiring me to re-do the select/pty parts in a way that was more
       palatable to me.
    
     - restartable system calls
    
       This was needed for Ted's code to do ^Z
    
     - Math emulation! The code was a total crock, and didn't bother with
       such unnecessary niceties as getting rounding right (or, to be
       honest, even getting more than about 60 bits right), but let's face
       it: it was enough to get work done.
    
       My math emulation was eventually to be entirely replaced by a much
       more complete, and much more precise implementation by Bill
       Metzenthen.  But my original stupid implementation actually ended
       living on at least for a while in BSD - I ended up making it
       available to the BSD people who couldn't use Bill's much better
       implementation due to licensing reasons.  I don't know whatever
       eventually happened to it.
    
     - support alignment check on i486+. Nobody seems to have ever used it,
       though.

             RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.12
    
    This is file mostly contains info on changed features of Linux, and
    using old versions as a help-reference might be a good idea.
    
             COPYRIGHT
    
    The Linux copyright will change: I've had a couple of requests to make
    it compatible with the GNU copyleft, removing the "you may not
    distribute it for money" condition.  I agree.  I propose that the
    copyright be changed so that it confirms to GNU - pending approval of
    the persons who have helped write code.  I assume this is going to be no
    problem for anybody: If you have grievances ("I wrote that code assuming
    the copyright would stay the same") mail me.  Otherwise The GNU copyleft
    takes effect as of the first of February.  If you do not know the gist
    of the GNU copyright - read it.
    
             INSTALLATION
    
    This is a SHORT install-note. The installation is very similar to 0.11,
    so read that (INSTALL-0.11) too. There are a couple of programs you will
    need to install linux: something that writes disk images (rawrite.exe or
    NU or...) and something that can create harddisk partitions (fdisk under
    xenix or older versions of dos, edpart.exe or something like that).
    
    NOTE! Repartitioning your harddisk will destroy all data on it (well,
    not exactly, but if you know enough to get back the data you probably
    didn't need this warning).  So be careful.
    
    READ THIS THROUGH, THEN READ INSTALL-0.11, AND IF YOU ARE SURE YOU KNOW
    WHAT YOU ARE DOING, CONTINUE.  OTHERWISE, PANIC.  OR WRITE ME FOR
    EXPLANATIONS.  OR DO ANYTHING BUT INSTALL LINUX - IT'S VERY SIMPLE, BUT
    IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SORRY.  I'D
    RATHER ANSWER A FEW UNNECESSARY MAILS THAN GET MAIL SAYING "YOU KILLED
    MY HARDDISK, BASTARD.  I'M GOING TO FIND YOU, AND YOU'LL BE SORRY WHEN I
    DO".
    
    1) back up everything you have on your harddisk - linux-0.12 is still in
       beta and might do weird things.  The only thing I guarantee is that
       it has worked fine on /my/ machine - for all I know it might eat your
       harddisk and spit it out in small pieces on any other hardware.
    
    2) Test out the linux boot-disk with the root file system.  If it
       doesn't work, check the hardware requirements, and mail me if you
       still think it should work.  I might not be able to help you, but
       your bug-report would still be appreciated.
    
       Test that linux can read your harddisk at least partly: run the fdisk
       program on the root-disk, and see if it barfs.  If it tells you about
       any partitions at all, linux can successfully read at least part of
       your harddisk.
    
    3) Make sure that you have a free /primary/ partition.  There can be 4
       primary partitions per drive: newer DOS fdisks seem to be able to
       create only 2 (one primary and one extended).  In that case use some
       other partitioning software: edpart.exe etc.  Linux fdisk currently
       only tells you the partition info - it doesn't write to the disk.
    
       Remember to check how big your partition was, as that can be used to
       tell which device Linux thinks it is.
    
    4) Boot up linux again, fdisk to make sure you now have the new
       partition, and use mkfs to make a filesystem on one of the partitions
       fdisk reports.  Write "mkfs -c /dev/hdX nnn" where X is the device
       number reported by linux fdisk, and nnn is the size - also reported
       by fdisk.  nnn is the size in /blocks/, ie kilobytes.  You should be
       able to use the size info to determine which partition is represented
       by which device name.
    
    5) Mount the new disk partition: "mount /dev/hdX /user".  Copy over the
       root filesystem to the harddisk, eg like this:
    
            # for i in bin dev etc usr tmp
            # do
            # cp +recursive /$i /user
            # done
    
       You caanot use just "cp +recursive / /user", as that will result in a
       loop.
    
    6) Sync the filesystem after you have played around enough, and reboot.
    
            # sync
            <wait for it to sync>
            ctrl-alt-del
    
       The folklore says you should do this three times before rebooting:
       once should be enough, but I admit I do it three times anyway :) THIS
       IS IMPORTANT! NEVER EVER FORGET TO SYNC BEFORE KILLING THE MACHINE.
    
    7) Change the bootdisk to understand which partition it should use as a
       root filesystem.  See INSTALL-0.11: it's still the word at offset
       508 into the image. You should be up and running.
    
    That's it. Go back and read the INSTALL-0.11
    
             New features of 0.12, in order of appearance
             (ie in the order you see them)
    
            Linux now prints cute dots when loading
    
    WoW. Run, don't walk, to see this :). Seriously, it should hopefully now
    load even on machines that never got off the ground before, but
    otherwise the loading hasn't changed. Implemented by drew.
    
            Super-VGA detection for extended alphamun modes
    
    I cannot guarantee it, I didn't write it, but it works great on a ET400
    SVGA card.  I'm addicted to the new look with 100x40 character editing,
    instead of a cramped 80x25.  This only works on VGA-cards that support
    higher text-resolutions, and which are correctly identified. Implemented
    by d88-man.
    
            Job Control.
    
    Ok, everybody used to typing ^Z after they started a long command, and
    forgot to put it in the background - now it works on linux too.  Bash
    knows the usualy job-control commands: bg, fg, jobs & kill.  I hope
    there will be no nasty surprises.  Job control was implemented by
    tytso@athena.mit.edu.
    
            Virtual consoles on EGA/VGA screens.
    
    You can select one of several consoles by pressing the left alt-key and
    a function key at the same time. Linux should report the number of
    virtual consoles available upon bootup. /dev/tty0 is now "the current"
    screen, /dev/tty1 is the main console, and /dev/tty2-8 can exist
    depending on your text-mode or card.
    
    NOTE! Scrolling is noticeably much slower with virtual consoles on a
    EGA/VGA. The reason is that no longer does linux use all the screen
    memory as a long buffer, but crams in several consoles in it. I think
    it's worth it.
    
    The virtual consoles also have some new screen-handling commands: they
    confirm even better to vt200 control codes than 0.11. Special graphic
    characters etc: you can well use them as terminals to VMS (although
    that's a shameful waste of resources).
    
            pty's
    
    Ok. I have to admit that I didn't get the hangup-code working correctly,
    but that should be easy to add. The general things are there.
    
            select
    
    I've never used it, so I cannot say how well it works. My minor testing
    seems to indicate that it works ok. vc's, pty's and select were
    implemented by pmacdona, although I hacked it heavily.
    
            387-emulation.
    
    It's not complete, but it works well enough to run those gcc2.0 compiled
    programs I tested (few).  None of the "heavy" math-functions are
    implemented yet.
    
            Symbolic links.
    
    Try out a few "ln -s xx yy", and ls -l. Note that I think tar should be
    recompiled to know anout them, and probably some other programs too. The
    0.12 rootimage-disk has most of the recompiled fileutilities.
    
            Virtual memory.
    
    In addition to the "mkfs" program, there is now a "mkswap" program on
    the root disk.  The syntax is identical: "mkswap -c /dev/hdX nnn", and
    again: this writes over the partition, so be careful.  Swapping can then
    be enabled by changing the word at offset 506 in the bootimage to the
    desired device.  Use the same program as for setting the root file
    system (but change the 508 offset to 506 of course).
    
    NOTE! This has been tested by Robert Blum, who has a 2M machine, and it
    allows you to run gcc without much memory.  HOWEVER, I had to stop using
    it, as my diskspace was eaten up by the beta-gcc-2.0, so I'd like to
    hear that it still works: I've been totally unable to make a
    swap-partition for even rudimentary testing since about christmastime.
    Thus the new changes could possibly just have backfired on the VM, but I
    doubt it.
    
            And that's it, I think.
    
    Happy hacking.

commit b65b60f4acd7efbbccd3d2411e9e5bca520a7574 (Dec 8 1991)

    Linux-0.11 (December 8, 1991)
    
    This was created from a re-packaged 0.11 tree.
    
    Linux-0.11 has a few rather major improvements, but perhaps most
    notably, is the first kernel where some other people start making
    real contributions.
    
     - I fixed the buffer cache code, making it a lot more stable
    
     - demand-loading from disk. My comment proudly states:
    
            Once more I can proudly say that linux stood up to being changed: it
            was less than 2 hours work to get demand-loading completely implemented.
    
       This is a major milestone, since it makes the kernel much more
       powerful than Minix was at the time.  I also share clean pages.
    
     - we still don't have an /sbin/init, but we now load /etc/rc at bootup,
       and the kernel will loop, spawning shells forever. That makes it easier
       to test things.
    
     - scaffolding for math emulation introduced.
    
     - Ted Ts'o shows up as a coder. Ted implements:
            o "#!" escape handling for executables
            o fixes for some file permission handling
            o "sticky" directory bit
            o first "malloc()/free()" implementation.
              (this one is horrible: the free needs the size for good
               performance, which will result in years of "free_s()" pains)
            o adds BSD-style setreuid/gid() handling
            o allows us to specify root device at image build time
            o cleanups of some of the uglier direct %fs-register accesses
    
     - Galen Hunt shows up as a coder: he's added code to handle different
       video card detection (whereas my original one just handled VGA, we
       now handle CGA, MGA, EGA and VGA)
    
     - The console can beep now: John T Kohl (who also does the tty KILL
       char handling)
    
     - we also now have German (Wolfgang Thiel) and French (Marc Corsini)
       keyboard maps.  World Domination!
    
    Btw, if you wonder what the "Urgel" comments are - I was still fairly
    Swedish-speaking, and "Urgel" is what I would these days write as "Ugh".
    
    It's a sign of trouble or ugly code.  The floppy driver in particular is
    clearly not something I'm very proud of ;).

    Linux 0.10 (November 11, 1991 ???)
    
    Likely correct 0.10: these were re-created from the RCS tree that Ted
    Ts'o had, no known pristine 0.10 tree (or, sadly, 0.02 and 0.03 trees)
    exist any more.
    
    Linux-0.10 was actually a major step.  It was _almost_ able to host
    itself, and if I remember correctly, a small patch I posted to the
    newsgroup a few days later got the buffer cache handling stable enough
    that Linux could now compile itself under itself without running out of
    memory due to a memory leak.
    
    Apart from bugfixes, the major update here is the support for
    mount/umount.  But you can also tell that others are starting to test
    out this thing, since the harddisk geometry is now auto-sensed, and we
    support the US keyboard layout in addition to the Finnish one.
    
    (This is also the first actual thing from the outside: the US keyboard
    layout tables came from Alfred Leung, although with major editing by me.)
    
     - add copyright messages ("(C) 1991  Linus Torvalds")
    
       Nobody else is really doing coding (yet..) but clearly I'm starting
       to be a lot more aware of other people here.
    
     - split up boot/boot.s into boot/bootsect.s and boot/setup.s
     - autodetect floppy type for booting
     - make root device and boot device configurable
    
     - support up to 16MB of physical memory (instead of just 8MB ;)
    
       Whee. We're clearly moving into the "big iron" phase of Linux.
    
     - move drivers around.  We now have separate subdirectories for
       character device drivers (tty and memory) and block device drivers.
    
     - initial floppy driver support!
    
       You can see how the "block layer" interfaces evolved directly from
       moving parts of the original hd.c driver into ll_rw_block.c and
       making them "generic".
    
     - make file reading do simple read-ahead
     - make file writing avoid reading in blocks that are totally overwritten
     - add support for /dev/port and /dev/null (!!)
     - improve pipe throughput
    
     - add support for sigaction(), not just old-style signal()
    
       This also rewrites most of the signal code in C rather than assembly.
    
     - add "mknod()" and "mount()"/"umount()" system calls, and support
       for traversing over mount-points.
    
     - add "sessions" and setsid(), so that we get proper SIGHUP's

    Linux-0.01 (September 17, 1991)
    
    This is the initial 0.01 kernel as found on various history sites.
    
    Fun facts:
    
     - kernel/Makefile still calls it the FREAX kernel
    
     - this was in a more innocent age, when the only copyright notice
       is a single "(C) 1991 Linus Torvalds" in lib/string.h
    
     - the keyboard driver was still in all assembly language, with a
       hardcoded map for (7-bit) Finnish keyboards. At least I had converted
       the VT100 emulation from assembly to C. Too bad I didn't keep the
       _really_ old code around for historical interest.
    
     - All the early kernels wanted a special version of gcc to compile: I
       had made extensions to gcc-1.40 to make it use the x86 string
       instructions for things like "memcpy()" using the "-mstring-insns"
       command line option.
    
     - Also, note that newer versions of gcc (which do have the inline
       intrisics, quite independently of my early -mstring-insns hack) will
       not accept the code: it needs a compiler that outputs old-style a.out
       format, and that accepts some of the strange inline assembly that I
       used.
    
     - In short: you really need some stone-age tools to actually compile
       this, if you actually want to.  And if you actually want to _run_ it
       too, you need to have some old hardware and most likely edit some of
       the hardcoded numbers too.  The harddisk driver has two different
       hardcoded settings: my harddisk, and Lasu's harddisk.
    
    Statistics:
    
    It's 88 files with about ten thousand lines, written by yours truly
    except for the vsprintf routine which was co-written with Lars
    Wirzenius.  Lasu wasn't as huge a fan of inline assembly as I was, thus
    the comment
    
            "Wirzenius wrote this portably, Torvalds fucked it up :-)"
    
    I think that comment pretty much sums it up ;)

    RELNOTES-0.01 - this file
    
             1. Short intro
    
    This is a free minix-like kernel for i386(+) based AT-machines.  Full
    source is included, and this source has been used to produce a running
    kernel on two different machines.  Currently there are no kernel
    binaries for public viewing, as they have to be recompiled for different
    machines.  You need to compile it with gcc (I use 1.40, don't know if
    1.37.1 will handle all __asm__-directives), after having changed the
    relevant configuration file(s).
    
    As the version number (0.01) suggests this is not a mature product.
    Currently only a subset of AT-hardware is supported (hard-disk, screen,
    keyboard and serial lines), and some of the system calls are not yet
    fully implemented (notably mount/umount aren't even implemented).  See
    comments or readme's in the code.
    
    This version is also meant mostly for reading - ie if you are interested
    in how the system looks like currently.  It will compile and produce a
    working kernel, and though I will help in any way I can to get it
    working on your machine (mail me), it isn't really supported.  Changes
    are frequent, and the first "production" version will probably differ
    wildly from this pre-alpha-release.
    
    Hardware needed for running linux:
            - 386 AT
            - VGA/EGA screen
            - AT-type harddisk controller (IDE is fine)
            - Finnish keyboard (oh, you can use a US keyboard, but not
              without some practise :-)
    
    The Finnish keyboard is hard-wired, and as I don't have a US one I
    cannot change it without major problems. See kernel/keyboard.s for
    details. If anybody is willing to make an even partial port, I'd be
    grateful. Shouldn't be too hard, as it's tabledriven (it's assembler
    though, so ...)
    
    Although linux is a complete kernel, and uses no code from minix or
    other sources, almost none of the support routines have yet been coded.
    Thus you currently need minix to bootstrap the system. It might be
    possible to use the free minix demo-disk to make a filesystem and run
    linux without having minix, but I don't know...
    
             2. Copyrights etc
    
    This kernel is (C) 1991 Linus Torvalds, but all or part of it may be
    redistributed provided you do the following:
    
            - Full source must be available (and free), if not with the
              distribution then at least on asking for it.
    
            - Copyright notices must be intact. (In fact, if you distribute
              only parts of it you may have to add copyrights, as there aren't
              (C)'s in all files.) Small partial excerpts may be copied
              without bothering with copyrights.
    
            - You may not distibute this for a fee, not even "handling"
              costs.
    
    Mail me at "torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi" if you have any questions.
    
    Sadly, a kernel by itself gets you nowhere. To get a working system you
    need a shell, compilers, a library etc. These are separate parts and may
    be under a stricter (or even looser) copyright. Most of the tools used
    with linux are GNU software and are under the GNU copyleft. These tools
    aren't in the distribution - ask me (or GNU) for more info.
    
             3. Short technical overview of the kernel.
    
    The linux kernel has been made under minix, and it was my original idea
    to make it binary compatible with minix. That was dropped, as the
    differences got bigger, but the system still resembles minix a great
    deal. Some of the key points are:
    
            - Efficient use of the possibilities offered by the 386 chip.
              Minix was written on a 8088, and later ported to other
              machines - linux takes full advantage of the 386 (which is
              nice if you /have/ a 386, but makes porting very difficult)
    
            - No message passing, this is a more traditional approach to
              unix. System calls are just that - calls. This might or might
              not be faster, but it does mean we can dispense with some of
              the problems with messages (message queues etc). Of course, we
              also miss the nice features :-p.
    
            - Multithreaded FS - a direct consequence of not using messages.
              This makes the filesystem a bit (a lot) more complicated, but
              much nicer. Coupled with a better scheduler, this means that
              you can actually run several processes concurrently without
              the performance hit induced by minix.
    
            - Minimal task switching. This too is a consequence of not using
              messages. We task switch only when we really want to switch
              tasks - unlike minix which task-switches whatever you do. This
              means we can more easily implement 387 support (indeed this is
              already mostly implemented)
    
            - Interrupts aren't hidden. Some people (among them Tanenbaum)
              think interrupts are ugly and should be hidden. Not so IMHO.
              Due to practical reasons interrupts must be mainly handled by
              machine code, which is a pity, but they are a part of the code
              like everything else. Especially device drivers are mostly
              interrupt routines - see kernel/hd.c etc.
    
            - There is no distinction between kernel/fs/mm, and they are all
              linked into the same heap of code. This has it's good sides as
              well as bad. The code isn't as modular as the minix code, but
              on the other hand some things are simpler. The different parts
              of the kernel are under different sub-directories in the
              source tree, but when running everything happens in the same
              data/code space.
    
    The guiding line when implementing linux was: get it working fast. I
    wanted the kernel simple, yet powerful enough to run most unix software.
    The file system I couldn't do much about - it needed to be minix
    compatible for practical reasons, and the minix filesystem was simple
    enough as it was. The kernel and mm could be simplified, though:
    
            - Just one data structure for tasks. "Real" unices have task
              information in several places, I wanted everything in one
              place.
    
            - A very simple memory management algorithm, using both the
              paging and segmentation capabilities of the i386. Currently
              MM is just two files - memory.c and page.s, just a couple of
              hundreds of lines of code.
    
    These decisions seem to have worked out well - bugs were easy to spot,
    and things work.
    
             4. The "kernel proper"
    
    All the routines handling tasks are in the subdirectory "kernel". These
    include things like 'fork' and 'exit' as well as scheduling and minor
    system calls like 'getpid' etc. Here are also the handlers for most
    exceptions and traps (not page faults, they are in mm), and all
    low-level device drivers (get_hd_block, tty_write etc). Currently all
    faults lead to a exit with error code 11 (Segmentation fault), and the
    system seems to be relatively stable ("crashme" hasn't - yet).
    
             5. Memory management
    
    This is the simplest of all parts, and should need only little changes.
    It contains entry-points for some things that the rest of the kernel
    needs, but mostly copes on it's own, handling page faults as they
    happen. Indeed, the rest of the kernel usually doesn't actively allocate
    pages, and just writes into user space, letting mm handle any possible
    'page-not-present' errors.
    
    Memory is dealt with in two completely different ways - by paging and
    segmentation.  First the 386 VM-space (4GB) is divided into a number of
    segments (currently 64 segments of 64Mb each), the first of which is the
    kernel memory segment, with the complete physical memory identity-mapped
    into it.  All kernel functions live within this area.
    
    Tasks are then given one segment each, to use as they wish. The paging
    mechanism sees to filling the segment with the appropriate pages,
    keeping track of any duplicate copies (created at a 'fork'), and making
    copies on any write. The rest of the system doesn't need to know about
    all this.
    
             6. The file system
    
    As already mentioned, the linux FS is the same as in minix. This makes
    crosscompiling from minix easy, and means you can mount a linux
    partition from minix (or the other way around as soon as I implement
    mount :-). This is only on the logical level though - the actual
    routines are very different.
    
            NOTE! Minix-1.6.16 seems to have a new FS, with minor
            modifications to the 1.5.10 I've been using. Linux
            won't understand the new system.
    
    The main difference is in the fact that minix has a single-threaded
    file-system and linux hasn't. Implementing a single-threaded FS is much
    easier as you don't need to worry about other processes allocating
    buffer blocks etc while you do something else. It also means that you
    lose some of the multiprocessing so important to unix.
    
    There are a number of problems (deadlocks/raceconditions) that the linux
    kernel needed to address due to multi-threading.  One way to inhibit
    race-conditions is to lock everything you need, but as this can lead to
    unnecessary blocking I decided never to lock any data structures (unless
    actually reading or writing to a physical device).  This has the nice
    property that dead-locks cannot happen.
    
    Sadly it has the not so nice property that race-conditions can happen
    almost everywhere.  These are handled by double-checking allocations etc
    (see fs/buffer.c and fs/inode.c).  Not letting the kernel schedule a
    task while it is in supervisor mode (standard unix practise), means that
    all kernel/fs/mm actions are atomic (not counting interrupts, and we are
    careful when writing those) if you don't call 'sleep', so that is one of
    the things we can count on.
    
             7. Apologies :-)
    
    This isn't yet the "mother of all operating systems", and anyone who
    hoped for that will have to wait for the first real release (1.0), and
    even then you might not want to change from minix.  This is a source
    release for those that are interested in seeing what linux looks like,
    and it's not really supported yet.  Anyone with questions or suggestions
    (even bug-reports if you decide to get it working on your system) is
    encouraged to mail me.
    
             8. Getting it working
    
    Most hardware dependancies will have to be compiled into the system, and
    there a number of defines in the file "include/linux/config.h" that you
    have to change to get a personalized kernel.  Also you must uncomment
    the right "equ" in the file boot/boot.s, telling the bootup-routine what
    kind of device your A-floppy is.  After that a simple "make" should make
    the file "Image", which you can copy to a floppy (cp Image /dev/PS0 is
    what I use with a 1.44Mb floppy).  That's it.
    
    Without any programs to run, though, the kernel cannot do anything. You
    should find binaries for 'update' and 'bash' at the same place you found
    this, which will have to be put into the '/bin' directory on the
    specified root-device (specified in config.h). Bash must be found under
    the name '/bin/sh', as that's what the kernel currently executes. Happy
    hacking.

Cronjob: A cronjob updates the kernel repo as well as the exlixir database at 1 O'clock (update-elixir.sh)
The paths are hardcoded in update-elixir.sh.
To limit the elixir database to our tags, the script.sh of elixir has been modified as follows:
diff --git a/script.sh b/script.sh
index 29cd68f..0b926da 100755
--- a/script.sh
+++ b/script.sh

             version_dir |
             sed 's/$/.0/' |
             sort -V |

Otherwise, exlisir will index *every* tag it finds, e.g., someone accidentally pushes all Linux tags to our repo.
By the way, this is the intended way of doing it. The readme tells us so: "For that reason, you may want to tweak the script (for example, by limiting the number of tags with a "head") in order to test the update and query commands." (https://github.com/free-electrons/elixir/blob/master/README.md)
